	abstract = {Ray-based cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) models have become a common feature of the radiation-hydrodynamic codes used to simulate inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments. These models are necessary for achieving better agreement with experimental measurements, but their detailed implementation can vary widely between the codes and often rely on artiﬁcial multipliers. To address this, a series of 2D and 3D test cases has been developed with validated solutions from wave-based calculations. Comparisons of various ray-based CBET models to the wave-based calculations highlight the essential physics that is required for accurate ray-based CBET modeling. Quantitative comparison metrics and/or ﬁeld data from the wave-based calculations have been made available for use in the validation of other ray-based CBET codes.},

	abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion experiments are sensitive to cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that redistributes laser energy in the coronal plasma through self-generated ion acoustic wave (IAW) gratings. The detailed CBET coupling depends on the polarization state of the crossing wavefields. CBET itself can also scramble the beam polarizations by inducing ellipticity through the IAW grating, and rotating the seed polarization toward that of the pump. We develop a ray-based model that describes the polarized CBET coupling and that is compatible with the framework of 3D inline radiative hydrodynamics simulations. The model is implemented in the ASTER/IFRIIT code and verified against an academic test case and an offline polarized CBET post-processor. It is then applied to the detailed configuration of the distributed polarization rotator system on OMEGA, where results highlight how polarized CBET induces significant low modes in the collisional absorption source term. Finally, the modeling is applied to a simple indirect-drive configuration, comparing CBET calculations with 96 unpolarized or polarized beams with 24 unpolarized quads. It is shown that these cases produce similar power amplification per cone of beams grouped with similar polar angles. However, the 96 beam geometry itself is found to reduce azimuthal variations in quad power after the interaction and favors beams with larger polar angles within the cones, an effect that is amplified by the polarized CBET. Application of the model to inline calculations of OMEGA implosions are presented in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {We present the first 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of directly driven inertial confinement fusion implosions with an inline package for polarized crossed-beam energy transfer, which were used to assess the impact of the current distributed polarization rotators (DPRs) on OMEGA as well as other known sources of asymmetry. Applied to OMEGA implosions, the simulations predict bang times with no need for ad hoc multipliers, as well as yields—if you separately account for the impacts of imprint and fuel age. The magnitude of the flow is well reproduced when the low mode sources are large, whereas the modeling of the stalk is thought to be required to match the flow magnitude in the remaining cases. For the cases explored in more detail, polarized cross-beam energy transfer (CBET)—the only known systematic drive asymmetry, brought the results closest to the measured flow vectors. The remaining discrepancies are shown to be stemming from the limited knowledge of the laser pointing modes. For typical current levels of beam mispointing, power imbalance, target offset, and asymmetry caused by polarized CBET, low modes degrade the yield by more than 40\%. The current strategy of attempting to compensate the mode-1 asymmetry with a preimposed target offset recovers only about one-third of the losses caused by the low modes due to the dynamic nature of the multiple asymmetries and the presence of low modes other than l = 1. Therefore, addressing the root causes of the drive asymmetries is apt to be more beneficial. To that end, one possible solution to the specific issue of polarized CBET (10 µm DPRs) is shown to work well.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to efficiently model 3-D laser plasma interactions at fluid scales is presented. This method, implemented in the IFRIIT propagation code developed at CELIA, relies on inverse ray tracing to compute laser fields at arbitrary locations in a plasma. This enables to describe the fields at high order in space compared to standard forward ray tracing approaches. In addition, inverse ray tracing enables the use of etalon integral methods to reconstruct caustic fields and greatly speeds up calculations of cross-beam energy transfer by decoupling the ray amplitude and ray phase calculations. A comparison of the inverse and forward methods for 3-D calculations of fields in presence or not of cross-beam energy transfer illustrates the significant advantages of the inverse method. Conversely, while the inverse method is well suited to most spherical plasma profiles, it currently cannot treat concave profiles or target holders. The coupling of IFRIIT with the 3-D ASTER radiative hydrodynamics code developed at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics is then presented. ASTER and IFRIIT resolve their respective equations on separate grids which communicate through interpolation. As such, IFRIIT uses a dedicated laser grid adapted to the computations at play, which also allows to use different parallelization methods for both codes: block decomposition for the hydrodynamics versus domain duplication for the laser. Applications to direct-drive implosions for inertial confinement fusion are presented, for which a geodesic icosahedron grid is implemented in IFRIIT. The performances of the ASTER/IFRIIT coupling are demonstrated by conducting simulations of cryogenic implosions performed on the OMEGA laser system, in presence of various sources of 3-D effects; laser port geometry, cross-beam energy transfer, beam imbalance and target mis-alignment. Comparison with neutron data, measured through bang-time, for a cryogenic implosion experiment shows an excellent agreement for the laser-plasma coupling.},

	abstract = {The prediction that laser plasma heating distorts the electron distribution function away from Maxwellian and towards a super-Gaussian distribution dates back four decades1. In conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, however, no direct evidence of this so-called ‘Langdon effect’ has previously been observed. Here we present measurements of the spatially and temporally resolved Thomson scattering spectrum that indicate the presence of super-Gaussian electron distribution functions consistent with existing theory2. In such plasmas, ion acoustic wave frequencies increase monotonically with the super-Gaussian exponent3. Our results show that the measured power transfer between crossed laser beams mediated by ion acoustic waves requires a model that accounts for the non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, whereas the standard Maxwellian calculations overpredict power transfer over a wide region of parameter space. Including this effect is expected to improve the predictive capability of crossed-beam energy transfer modelling at the National Ignition Facility in California and may restore a larger operable design space for inertial confinement fusion experiments. This is also expected to motivate further inquiry in other areas affected by non-Maxwellian electron distribution functions, such as laser absorption, heat transport and X-ray spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {The compression of direct-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) targets is strongly impacted by cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that limits ablation pressure by redirecting laser energy outward and that is projected to be mitigated by laser bandwidth. Here, we explore various CBET mitigation constraints to guide the design of future ICF facilities. First, we ﬁnd that the ﬂat, Gaussian, and Lorentzian spectral shapes have similar CBET mitigation properties, and a ﬂat shape with nine spectral lines is a good surrogate for what can be obtained with other spectral shapes. Then, we conduct a comprehensive study across energy scales and ignition designs. 3D hydrodynamic simulations are used to derive an analytical model for the expected CBET mitigation as a function of laser and plasma parameters. From this model, we study the bandwidth requirements of conventional and shock ignition designs across four different energy scales and ﬁnd that they require between 0.5 and 3 6 0:2\% relative bandwidth. Best mitigation is achieved when the beam radius over critical radius Rb=Rc is kept low during the drive while the plasma temperature is kept high. In a steady state, we ﬁnd that the bandwidth required to mitigate 85\% of CBET scales as ðRb=RcÞ2:15LÀn 0:58I0:7, where Ln is the density scale length, and I the laser intensity. Finally, we ﬁnd that the chamber beam port layout does not inﬂuence CBET mitigation. In the case of a driver using many monochromatic beamlets, we ﬁnd that \$10 beamlets per port is required, with diminishing returns above \$20.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) results from two-beam energy exchange via seeded stimulated Brillouin scattering, which detrimentally reduces laser-energy absorption for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion. Consequently, ablation pressure and implosion velocity suffer from the decreased absorption, reducing target performance in both symmetric and polar direct drive. Additionally, CBET alters the time-resolved scattered-light spectra and redistributes absorbed and scattered-light–changing shell morphology and low-mode drive symmetry. Mitigating CBET is demonstrated in inertial confinement implosions at the National Ignition Facility by detuning the laser-source wavelengths (±2.3 Å UV) of the interacting beams. In polar direct drive, wavelength detuning was shown to increase the equatorial region velocity experimentally by 16\% and to alter the in-flight shell morphology. These experimental observations are consistent with design predictions of radiation–hydrodynamic simulations that indicate a 10\% increase in the average ablation pressure. These results indicate that wavelength detuning successfully mitigates CBET. Simulations predict that optimized phase plates and wavelength-detuning CBET mitigation utilizing the three-legged beam layout of the OMEGA Laser System significantly increase absorption and achieve \&gt;100-Gbar hot-spot pressures in symmetric direct drive.},

Each reﬁnement can be seen as a ﬁner grid in a multiple-grid system. The standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates using a multiple-grid system is detailed and an inadequacy in the method is presented. A new algorithm of particle to node weighting in a multiple-grid system is then described and compared to the standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates. This description pays particular attention to the nodes near the interface between grids of diﬀering cell-size. The volume weighting method used in this study is geometrically similar to the standard bilinear PIC method in Cartesian coordinates, but weights in proportion to the volumes of revolution of the areas about the z-axis, rather than the areas themselves. As the volume weighting method has the axisymmetric geometry built in, it is a natural system to use in this particular case. A full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of metal plasma-immersion ion implantation and deposition (MePIIID) of a ﬂat stage using three grids of cell size: 0.5 · 0.5, 1 · 1 and 2 · 2 mm; is performed and results are compared to those obtained from a single-grid simulation with the same parameters.

	abstract = {Understanding magnetised laser–plasma interactions is important for controlling magneto-inertial fusion experiments and developing magnetically assisted radiation and particle sources. For nanosecond pulses at non-relativistic intensities, interactions are dominated by coherent three-wave interactions, whose nonlinear coupling coefﬁcients became known only recently when waves propagate at oblique angles with the magnetic ﬁeld. In this paper, backscattering coupling coefﬁcients predicted by warm-ﬂuid theory are benchmarked using particle-in-cell simulations in one spatial dimension, and excellent agreements are found for a wide range of plasma temperatures, magnetic ﬁeld strengths and laser propagation angles, when the interactions are mediated by electron-dominant hybrid waves. Systematic comparisons between theory and simulations are made possible by a rigorous protocol. On the theory side, the initial boundary value problem of linearised three-wave equations is solved, and the transient-time solutions allow the effects of growth and damping to be distinguished. On the simulation side, parameters are carefully chosen and calibration runs are performed to ensure that comparisons are well controlled. Fitting simulation data to analytical solutions yields numerical growth rates that match theory predictions within error bars. Although warm-ﬂuid theory is found to be valid for a wide parameter range, genuine kinetic effects have also been observed.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) is thought to be responsible for a 30\% reduction in hydrodynamic coupling efficiency on OMEGA and up to 50\% at the ignition scale for direct-drive (DD) implosions. These numbers are determined by ray-based models that have been developed and integrated within the radiation–hydrodynamics codes LILAC (1-D) and DRACO (2-D). However, ray-based modeling of CBET in an inhomogeneous plasma assumes a steady-state plasma response, does not include the effects of beam speckle, and treats ray caustics in an ad hoc manner. The validity of the modeling for ignition-scale implosions has not yet been determined. To address the physics shortcomings, which have important implications for DD inertial confinement fusion, a new wave-based model has been developed. It solves the time-enveloped Maxwell equations in three dimensions, including polarization effects, plasma inhomogeneity, and open-boundary conditions with the ability to prescribe beams incident at arbitrary angles. Beams can be made realistic with respect to laser speckle, polarization smoothing, and laser bandwidth. This, coupled to a linearized low-frequency plasma response that does not assume a steady state, represents the most-complete model of CBET to date.},

	abstract = {The performance of direct-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion implosions relies critically on the coupling of laser energy to the target plasma. Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), the resonant exchange of energy between intersecting laser beams mediated by ponderomotively driven ion-acoustic waves (IAWs), inhibits this coupling by scattering light into unwanted directions. The variety of beam intersection angles and varying plasma conditions in an implosion results in IAWs with a range of phase velocities. Here, we show that CBET saturates through a resonance detuning that depends on the IAW phase velocity and that results from trapping-induced modiﬁcations to the ion distribution functions. For smaller phase velocities, the modiﬁcations to the distribution functions can rapidly thermalize in the presence of mid-Z ions, leading to a blueshift in the resonant frequency. For larger phase velocities, the modiﬁcations can persist, leading to a redshift in the resonant frequency. Ultimately, these results may reveal pathways toward CBET mitigation and inform reduced models for radiation hydrodynamics codes to improve their predictive capability.},

We choose laser and plasma conditions for the simulations that are favorable to CBET and promote nonlinearity. Through a comparison of outputs from the particle-in-cell code vector particle in cell (VPIC) and the linearized fluid code laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE), a series of nonlinear effects have been identified in the kinetic simulations that include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion-acoustic wave self-focusing. These effects produce time-dependent energy transfer, in contrast to the linearized fluid simulations in which a steady state is reached after an initial transient. Ion trapping is shown to allow for increased energy transfer relative to fluid simulations, with the remaining nonlinear processes acting to reduce the energy transfer. Nonlinear dynamics is contrasted for low- and high-intensity beams as well as between speckled and planar beams. For the parameters under consideration, beam profile has a significant effect on nonlinear dynamics, though the greatest sensitivity is to beam intensity.},

Existing linear theory is generalized to treat broadband lasers, demonstrating that CBET is most effectively suppressed when the bandwidth exceeds the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) frequency. It is shown that for such bandwidths, reverse (seed to pump) transfer becomes possible, which reduces the net energy transfer rapidly as bandwidth is increased. The CBET gain exponent in this regime scales with bandwidth (Δω) as Δω−3 for Gaussian or Lorentzian laser spectra with different scalings possible for other spectra. Comparison of our theory with linearized fluid and particle-in-cell simulations, performed with the laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE) and vector particle in cell (VPIC) codes, respectively, finds that the model is accurate in the absence of nonlinear processes. However, linear analysis also finds that the IAW energy density scales as Δω−1, implying that nonlinear effects may be more difficult to control than the CBET scaling would suggest. Indeed, nonlinear effects are found to be present in VPIC simulations with high-intensity lasers, despite minimal apparent CBET. Nonlinear processes in the VPIC cases include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion wave self-focusing. In some high intensity VPIC cases, these effects lead to net energy transfer from seed to pump and increases to backscatter stimulated Brillouin scattering reflectivities. Finally, for a given bandwidth, we show that improved control of nonlinear processes can be achieved via smoothing by spectral dispersion.},

            Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The energy density of these fields is typically comparable to the energy density of the fluid motions of the plasma in which they are embedded, making magnetic fields essential players in the dynamics of the luminous matter. The standard theoretical model for the origin of these strong magnetic fields is through the amplification of tiny seed fields via turbulent dynamo to the level consistent with current observations. However, experimental demonstration of the turbulent dynamo mechanism has remained elusive, since it requires plasma conditions that are extremely hard to re-create in terrestrial laboratories. Here we demonstrate, using laser-produced colliding plasma flows, that turbulence is indeed capable of rapidly amplifying seed fields to near equipartition with the turbulent fluid motions. These results support the notion that turbulent dynamo is a viable mechanism responsible for the observed present-day magnetization.},

	abstract = {Astrophysical collisionless shocks are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. Generated by violent interactions of supersonic plasma flows with the interstellar medium, supernova remnant shocks are observed to amplify magnetic fields1 and accelerate electrons and protons to highly relativistic speeds2–4. In the well-established model of diffusive shock acceleration5, relativistic particles are accelerated by repeated shock crossings. However, this requires a separate mechanism that pre-accelerates particles to enable shock crossing. This is known as the ‘injection problem’, which is particularly relevant for electrons, and remains one of the most important puzzles in shock acceleration6. In most astrophysical shocks, the details of the shock structure cannot be directly resolved, making it challenging to identify the injection mechanism. Here we report results from laser-driven plasma flow experiments, and related simulations, that probe the formation of turbulent collisionless shocks in conditions relevant to young supernova remnants. We show that electrons can be effectively accelerated in a first-order Fermi process by small-scale turbulence produced within the shock transition to relativistic non-thermal energies, helping overcome the injection problem. Our observations provide new insight into electron injection at shocks and open the way for controlled laboratory studies of the physics underlying cosmic accelerators. In laser–plasma experiments complemented by simulations, electron acceleration is observed in turbulent collisionless shocks. This work clarifies the pre-acceleration to relativistic energies required for the onset of diffusive shock acceleration.},

However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly collisional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in galaxy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a system in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a reduction of heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading to large temperature variations on small spatial scales (as is seen in cluster plasmas).

A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study α-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Irradiating a small capsule containing deuterium and tritium fuel directly with intense laser light causes it to implode, which creates a plasma hot enough to initiate fusion reactions between the fuel nuclei. Here we report on such laser direct-drive experiments and observe that the fusion reactions produce more energy than the amount of energy in the central so-called hot-spot plasma. This condition is identified as having a hot-spot fuel gain greater than unity. A hot-spot fuel gain of around four was previously accomplished at the National Ignition Facility in indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments where the capsule is irradiated by X-rays. In that case, up to 1.9 MJ of laser energy was used, but in contrast, our experiments on the OMEGA laser system require as little as 28 kJ. As the hot-spot fuel gain is predicted to grow with laser energy and target size, our work establishes the direct-drive approach to inertial fusion as a promising path towards burning and ignited plasmas in the laboratory. Additionally, we report a record (direct-drive) fusion yield of 0.9 kJ on OMEGA, which we achieved with thin-ice deuterium–tritium liner targets.},

The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser–plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 μm—the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser—and 0.248 μm (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon–decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts.

Different assumptions underlie previous analytic frameworks that provide predictions for wavelength scaling of many important target parameters. These are explored and compared to radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of laser-driven targets. We are particularly interested here in lasers with wavelengths between 0:193 lm [wavelength of the Argon Flouride (ArF) excimer laser] and 0:527 lm (the frequency-doubled glass Nd:glass laser). Shortwavelength drivers have signiﬁcant advantages for directly driven ICF targets, which are summarized here. We show that constraints such as providing a certain pressure or avoiding laser-plasma instability thresholds allow shorter laser wavelengths to provide energy savings, pressure enhancements, and/or higher hydrodynamic efﬁciencies. We also consider potential disadvantages, such as increased laser imprint or exposure to the Landau–Darrieus instability. These are shown to be either minor and/or can be easily remediated.},

Short-wavelength drivers have significant advantages, primarily in using less power and energy to drive targets. Additionally, they expand the allowed operating regime that is constrained by LPI avoidance and the production of higher pressures needed for more hydrodynamically stable targets.

The paraxial complex geometrical optics (PCGO) is adapted for light waves in an inhomogeneous medium and modified to include the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption and the ponderomotive force. This thick-ray model is compared to the standard ray-tracing (RT) approach, both in the chic code. The PCGO model leads to different power deposition patterns and better diffraction modeling compared to standard RT codes. The intensity-reconstruction technique used in RT codes to model nonlinear LPI leads to artificial filamentation and fails to reproduce realistic ponderomotive self-focusing distances, intensity amplifications, and density channel depletions, whereas PCGO succeeds. Bundles of Gaussian thick rays can be used to model realistic non-Gaussian ICF beams. The PCGO approach is expected to improve the accuracy of ICF simulations and serve as a basis to implement diverse LPI effects in large-scale hydrocodes.},

	abstract = {Indirect drive inertial confinement fusion experiments with convergence ratios below 17 have been previously shown to be less susceptible to Rayleigh–Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities, making this regime highly interesting for fusion science. Additional limitations imposed on the implosion velocity, in-flight aspect ratio and applied laser power aim to further reduce instability growth, resulting in a new regime where performance can be well represented by one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic simulations. A simulation campaign was performed using the 1D radiation-hydrodynamics code HYADES to investigate the performance that could be achieved using direct-drive implosions of liquid layer capsules, over a range of relevant energies. Results include potential gains of 0.19 on LMJ-scale systems and 0.75 on NIF-scale systems, and a reactor-level gain of 54 for an 8.5 MJ implosion. While the use of 1D simulations limits the accuracy of these results, they indicate a sufficiently high level of performance to warrant further investigations and verification of this new low-instability regime. This potentially suggests an attractive new approach to fusion energy.

	abstract = {A 3-D ray based model for computing laser ﬁelds in dissipative and amplifying media is presented. The eikonal equation is solved using inverse ray-tracing on a dedicated nonstructured 3-D mesh. Inverse ray-tracing opens the possibility of using Complex Geometrical Optics (CGO), for which we propose a propagation formalism in a ﬁnite element mesh. Divergent ﬁelds at caustics are corrected using an etalon integral method for fold-type caustics. This method is successfully applied in dissipative media by modifying the ray-ordering and root selection rules, thereby allowing one to reconstruct the ﬁeld in the entire caustic region. In addition, we demonstrate how caustics in the CGO framework can disappear entirely for sufﬁciently dissipative media, making the complex ray approach valid in the entire medium. CGO is shown to offer a more precise modeling of laser refraction and absorption in a dissipative medium when compared to Geometrical Optics (GO). In the framework of Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion (ICF), this occurs mostly at intermediate temperatures or at high temperatures close to the critical density. Additionally, GO is invalid at low temperatures if an approximated expression of the permittivity is used. The inverse ray-tracing algorithm for GO and CGO is implemented in the IFRIIT code, in the framework of a dielectric permittivity described in 3-D using a piecewise linear approximation in tetrahedrons. Fields computed using GO and CGO are compared to results from the electromagnetic wave solver Laser Plasma Simulation Environment. Excellent agreement is obtained in 1-D linear and nonlinear permittivity proﬁles. Good agreement is also obtained for ICF-like Gaussian density proﬁles in 2-D. Finally, we demonstrate how the model reproduces Gaussian beam diffraction using CGO. The IFRIIT code will be interfaced inline to 3-D radiative hydrodynamic codes to describe the nonlinear laser plasma interaction in ICF and high-energy-density plasmas.},

	abstract = {Integrated hydrodynamics simulations of inertial conﬁnement fusion rely on reduced physics models. To reproduce experimental trends, these models often feature tuning parameters, but this comes with a risk: the over-tuning of one model can hide physics inadequacies in another. The ray-based models of cross-beam-energy transfer (CBET) represent this risk. Here, we present an accurate and efﬁcient model of CBET suitable for inline implementation in 3D hydrodynamics simulations. Inverse Ray Tracing (IRT) is used to compute the ray ﬁeld in a 3D permittivity proﬁle described on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh using the Inline Field Reconstruction and Interaction using Inverse Tracing framework. CBET is accounted for through perturbations to the permittivity associated with ion acoustic waves driven by the overlapped ﬁelds. Large gradients in the permittivity are resolved by coupling the IRT to a recursive Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement (AMR) algorithm. The use of AMR also allows for the resolution of caustics, with accurate ﬁeld reconstruction performed using the Etalon integral method. Comparisons of the model with wave-based solutions from the Laser Plasma Simulation Environment demonstrate its ability to control energy conservation and gain convergence through the AMR depth only, without the use of ad hoc physical models or artiﬁcial tuning parameters.},

The target consisted of a gold vacuum rugby-shaped hohlraum and a plastic capsule located at its center, filled with deuterium gas fuel. The arrangement of the 12 quads is such that the laser irradiation on the wall generated a three-dimensional (3D) x-ray flux around the capsule creating 3D deformations on the imploding plastic shell. This constraint forced the design of a robust target (relatively thin ablator, around 40 lm) driven by a short laser pulse (3 ns) that delivered about 1011 neutrons. Full-integrated 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations allowed both the target definition and the data interpretation (mainly radiation temperature, x-ray images, and neutron yield). 3D calculations and experiments compare well.},

These energy exchanges and scatterings are described by a Monte Carlo method simulating the creation/annihilation of rays. The algorithm has been validated against other numerical solvers and, in the case of CBET, by means of kinetic simulations. The method is efﬁcient and can be easily implemented in already existing ray tracing packages used in many hydrodynamic codes.

	abstract = {The Crossed Beam Energy Transfer (CBET) of two large laser beams is modeled using two approaches: (i) the time-independent Paraxial Complex Geometrical Optics (PCGO) for stochastically distributed Gaussian-shaped beamlets and (ii) the time-dependent conventional paraxial propagation of smoothed laser beams. Each description of the laser propagation is coupled to a hydrodynamics code. Both approaches are compared in a well-defined plasma configuration with density- and velocity- profiles corresponding to an inhomogeneous plasma, including a resonance zone in which the matching conditions for a resonant coupling between the two laser beams are fulfilled. The comparison is made for laser beams smoothed by random phase plates and for “regular beams” without speckles. The role of the laser speckles is also investigated for each approach. In general, a good agreement is found between the PCGO simulations and the fully time-dependent paraxial-type simulations, carried out with the code Harmony, past a transient period on the picosecond time scale. The PCGO-based CBET model is applied to the hydrodynamics simulations of a CBET experiment, the results of which reproduce essential features of the experimental data. Based on these comparisons, performed for interaction parameters up to 2×1014W cm−2μm2, the PCGO approach proves to be a reliable method to be implemented in the hydrodynamics codes to describe the CBET in mm-scale plasmas.},

	abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion, pellets of deuterium tritium fuel are compressed and heated to the conditions where they undergo fusion and release energy. The target gain (ratio of energy released from the fusion reactions to the energy in the drive source) is a key parameter in determining the power flow and economics of an inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant. In this study, the physics of gain is explored for laser-direct-drive targets with driver energy at the megajoule scale. This analysis is performed with the assumption of next-generation laser technologies that are expected to increase convergent drive pressures to over 200 Mbar. This is possible with the addition of bandwidth to the laser spectrum and by employing focal-spot zooming. Simple physics arguments are used to derive scaling laws that describe target gain as a function of laser energy, adiabat, ablation pressure, and implosion velocity. Scaling laws are found for the unablated mass, ablation pressure, areal density, implosion velocity, and in-flight aspect ratio. Those scaling laws are then used to explore the design space for IFE targets.},

Results with low-mode asymmetries are used to estimate the magnitude of anisotropy in the neutron spectra shift, width, and shape. Comparisons of primary and down scattered images highlight the lack of alignment between the neutron sources, scatter sites, and detector plane, which limits the ability to infer the ρr of the fuel from a down scattered ratio. Further calculations use high bandwidth multi-mode perturbations to induce multiple short scale length flows in the hotspot. The results indicate that the effect of fluid velocity is to produce a DT neutron spectrum with an apparently higher temperature than that inferred from the DD spectrum and which is also higher than the temperature implied by the DT to DD yield ratio.},

It is simple in construction and use, and provides more uniform width of the latitudinal rings than other methods of equal-area pixelization of a spherical surface. The new method provides rectangular grid cells with latitude- and longitude-oriented boundaries, near-square cells in the equatorial rings, and the closest to uniform width of the latitudinal rings as compared with other equal-area isolatitudinal grids. The binned data is easy to visualize and interpret in terms of the longitude–latitude rectangular coordinate system, natural for astronomy and geodesy. Grids with an arbitrary number of rings and, consequently, a wide and theoretically unlimited range of cell size can be built by the proposed method. Comparison with other methods used in astronomical research showed the advantages of the new approach in the sense of uniformity of the ring width, a wider range of grid resolution, and simplicity of use.},

	abstract = {Eigensolutions of the spherical Laplacian operator on the cubed‐sphere and the icosahedral (‐hexagonal) grid were investigated. For the cubed‐sphere grid, the Laplacian operator was discretized with the Spectral Element Method (SEM) using the Lagrange–Legendre Polynomials (LLP), while, for the icosahedral grid, the Finite Difference Method (FDM) was employed. The discrete Laplacian operator was formulated into matrix equations with respect to the unknowns of the global‐domain grid‐point values. The eigenvalues of the matrix exhibited a step‐function‐like behaviour: there are 2
              n
              + 1 identical (degenerate) eigenvalues for the degree
              n
              , the total wave‐number‐like index. Unlike the spherical harmonic functions, the eigenvectors were found to be not separable into zonal and meridional structure: a part of them reflected the basic geometry of grids, i.e. the cube (icosahedron) for the cubed‐sphere (icosahedral) grid. These eigenvectors were shown to consist of only a couple of spherical harmonics. The eigensolutions indicated that the Rossby–Haurwitz waves, the normal modes of absolute‐vorticity conserving motion, are affected significantly by the underlying grid system in both horizontal structure (resulting in geodesic Rossby–Haurwitz waves) and phase speed (being larger than theory for the cubed‐sphere SEM, but smaller for the icosahedral FDM). It was implied by the eigensolutions that when a prognostic equation incorporates Laplacian‐type hyperviscosity, the maximum viscosity coefficient for the cubed‐sphere SEM should be given significantly smaller than for the icosahedral FDM, particularly in the case of high resolution with the high‐order LLP. Selective filtering or diffusing small‐scales was revealed to be practiced more effectively for the cubed‐sphere SEM than the icosahedral FDM. The eigenvectors are also discussed in relation to the grid imprinting of the numerical models built on those geodesic grids.},

	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

	abstract = {A mesh of nodes used in particle-in-cell simulations may be reﬁned in some regions to obtain better local spatial resolution without adding excessive computational cost. Each reﬁnement can be seen as a ﬁner grid in a multiple-grid system. The standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates using a multiple-grid system is detailed and an inadequacy in the method is presented. A new algorithm of particle to node weighting in a multiple-grid system is then described and compared to the standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates. This description pays particular attention to the nodes near the interface between grids of diﬀering cell-size. The volume weighting method used in this study is geometrically similar to the standard bilinear PIC method in Cartesian coordinates, but weights in proportion to the volumes of revolution of the areas about the z-axis, rather than the areas themselves. As the volume weighting method has the axisymmetric geometry built in, it is a natural system to use in this particular case. A full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of metal plasma-immersion ion implantation and deposition (MePIIID) of a ﬂat stage using three grids of cell size: 0.5 · 0.5, 1 · 1 and 2 · 2 mm; is performed and results are compared to those obtained from a single-grid simulation with the same parameters. The multiple grid method compares very well to the single-grid simulation.},

At sufficiently high intensities (≊1014 W/cm2) the gas is ionized and heated by a laser absorption wave propagating faster than the sound speed. For pulses under 2 ns, the bulk of the plasma remains stationary, resulting in efficient heating minimizing density and velocity gradients, which are particularly important for instability thresholds in nonuniform plasmas. The propagation of a laser absorption wave in a preionized plasma is derived analytically. Ionization resulting from multiphoton and electron avalanche processes is studied by numerical methods and dimensional analysis. This establishes the length and time scales over which an absorption wave can be observed. Computer simulations, using the lasnex code, are presented for several implementations of this concept, applicable to the relevant regime for inertial confinement fusion. These examples include a gas jet (≊3×1 mm in cross section), 3 to 4 mm diameter gas balloons, and gas puffs generated by exploding a foil with a low-energy prepulse (≊200 J).},

The ray-based models assume locally plane-wave laser beams and polarization-averaged incoherence between laser speckles for beams with polarization smoothing. The impact of beam speckle and polarization smoothing on CBET are studied using the 3-D wave-based laser–plasma interaction code LPSE. The results indicate that ray-based models underpredict CBET when the assumption of spatially averaged longitudinal incoherence across the CBET interaction region is violated. A model for CBET between linearly polarized speckled beams is presented that uses ray tracing to solve for the real speckle pattern of the unperturbed laser beams within the eikonal approximation and gives excellent agreement with the wave-based calculations. OMEGA-scale 2-D LPSE calculations using ICF-relevant plasma conditions suggest that the impact of beam speckle on laser absorption calculations in ICF implosions is small (\&lt;1\%).},

	abstract = {Low-mode asymmetries have emerged as one of the primary challenges to achieving high-performing inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) implosions. In direct-drive ICF, an important potential seed of such asymmetries is the capsule stalk mount, the impact of which has remained a contentious question. In this paper, we describe the results from an experiment on the OMEGA laser with intentional offsets at varying angles to the capsule stalk mount, which clearly demonstrates the impact of the stalk mount on implosion dynamics. The angle between stalk and offset is found to signiﬁcantly impact observables. Speciﬁcally, a larger directional ﬂow is observed in neutron spectrum measurements when the offset is toward rather than away from the stalk, while an offset at 42  to the stalk gives minimal directional ﬂow but still generates a large ﬂow ﬁeld in the implosion. No signiﬁcant directional ﬂow is seen due to stalk only. Time-integrated x-ray images support these ﬂow observations. A trend is also seen in implosion yield, with lower yield obtained for offsets with a smaller angle than with a larger angle toward the stalk. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations using 2D DRACO and 2D/3D Chimera not including the stalk mount and using 2D xRAGE including the stalk mount are brought to bear on the data. The yield trend, the minimal directional ﬂow with stalk only, and the larger ﬂow enhancement observed with the offset toward the stalk are all reproduced in the xRAGE simulations. The results strongly indicate that the stalk impact must be considered and mitigated to achieve high-performing implosions.},

	abstract = {The effects of two types of target mounts, stalks and spider silks, on the implosion of both room-temperature D2-gas-filled shells and cryogenic D2-ice-filled shells have been studied both experimentally and by means of two-dimensional simulations. The simulations indicate that the hydrodynamic effect of the expanding plasma created by the ablation of material from the target mounts and refraction of laser light by this plasma induce perturbations in the imploding shell that are damaging to the implosion. The spider silks are the more-damaging type of mount since the silks (typically four) are arrayed over the target surface, whereas the stalk (typically one) meets the target at a single point. Stalks are therefore preferred over silks as a target mount. The scale and magnitude of the perturbations induced by the spider silks have been verified by planar-target experiments performed on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly, D. L. Brown, R. S. Craxton et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1995)]. The perturbations predicted by simulations to arise from stalks qualitatively agree with the results of implosion experiments using Ti-doped plastic shells.},

Sources of these nonuniformities include an illumination pattern produced by 60 OMEGA laser beams, capsule offsets (∼10–20 μm), and imperfect pointing, power balance, and timing of the beams (with typical σrms∼10 μm, 10\%, and 5 ps, respectively). Two implosion designs using 26-kJ triple-picket laser pulses were studied: a nominal design, in which an 874-μm-diameter capsule is illuminated by about the same-diameter beams, and a more hydrodynamically efficient “R75” design using a 900-μm-diameter capsule and beams of 75\% of this diameter. Simulations show that nonuniformities caused by capsule offsets and beam imbalance have the largest effect on implosion performance. These nonuniformities lead to significant distortions of implosion cores, resulting in an increased residual kinetic energy and incomplete stagnation. The shape of distorted cores can be well characterized using neutron images but is less represented by 4–8 keV x-ray images. Simulated neutron spectra from perturbed implosions show large directional variations because of bulk motion effects and up to an ∼2 keV variation of the hot-spot temperature inferred from these spectra. The R75 design suffers more from illumination nonuniformities. Simulations show an advantage of this design over the nominal design when the target offset and beam power imbalance σrms are reduced to less than 5 μm and 5\%, respectively.},

This appears to be due to crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) that involves electromagnetic-seeded, low-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering. CBET scatters energy from the central portion of the incoming light beam to outgoing light, reducing the laser absorption and hydrodynamic efficiency of implosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including CBET show good agreement with all observables in implosion experiments on OMEGA. Three strategies to mitigate CBET and improve laser coupling are considered: the use of narrow beams, multicolor lasers, and higher-Z ablators. Experiments on OMEGA using narrow beams have demonstrated improvements in implosion performance.},

	abstract = {The optimization of radio frequency-wave (RF) systems for fusion experiments is often performed using ray-tracing codes, which rely on the geometrical-optics (GO) approximation. However, GO fails at caustics such as cutoffs and focal points, erroneously predicting the wave intensity to be inﬁnite. This is a critical shortcoming of GO, since the caustic wave intensity is often the quantity of interest, e.g., RF heating. Full-wave modeling can be used instead, but the computational cost limits the speed at which such optimizations can be performed. We have developed a less expensive alternative called metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO). Instead of evolving waves in the usual x (coordinate) or k (spectral) representation, MGO uses a mixed X   Ax þ Bk representation. By continuously adjusting the matrix coefﬁcients A and B along the rays, one can ensure that GO remains valid in the X coordinates without caustic singularities. The caustic-free result is then mapped back onto the original x space using metaplectic transforms. Here, we overview the MGO theory and review algorithms that will aid the development of an MGO-based ray-tracing code. We show how using orthosymplectic transformations leads to considerable simpliﬁcations compared to previously published MGO formulas. We also prove explicitly that MGO exactly reproduces standard GO when evaluated far from caustics (an important property that until now has only been inferred from numerical simulations), and we relate MGO to other semiclassical caustic-removal schemes published in the literature. This discussion is then augmented by an explicit comparison of the computed spectrum for a wave bounded between two cutoffs.},

If a pencil of light has geometric mean cross section size of the order p times the wavelength, it can propagate independently to a distance p2 times the wavelength, where most of the beam energy diﬀuses out of the beam region. This is consistent with a statement that van de Hulst made in a classical text on light scattering. The electromagnetic near ﬁelds in the pencil of light are not uniform, have complicated patterns within short distances from the beam base, and the ﬁelds tend to converge to Fraunhofer diﬀraction ﬁelds far away from the base.},

As large amounts of power are transferred between laser beams at the entrance holes of NIF hohlraums, the presence of many overlapping beat waves can lead to stochastic ion heating in the regions where laser beams overlap [P. Michel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 195004 (2012)]. This increases the ion acoustic velocity and modifies the ion acoustic waves’ dispersion relation, thus reducing the plasma response to the beat waves and the efficiency of CBET. This pushes the plasma oscillations driven by CBET in a regime where the phase velocities are much smaller than both the electron and ion thermal velocities. CBET gains are derived for this new regime and generalized to the case of multi ion species plasmas.},

In addition, some useful results are obtained analytically from expansions of the kinetic dispersion relation and from fluid models. However, these results disagree with the numerical results in domains of particular practical interest. When ion temperatures exceed two-tenths of the electron temperature, the least damped mode is the one with the smaller phase velocity, and this mode is then found to dominate the ponderomotive response of the CH plasma.},

The hydrodynamic efﬁciency, deﬁned as the ratio of the kinetic energy in the imploding shell to the laser energy, increased from 4.5\% to 5.0\% based on radiation-hydrodynamic calculations benchmarked to shell trajectory and bang-time measurements. The higher coupling came with a trade-off of an increased hot-electron production as well as increased hydrodynamic instabilities seeded by a larger mode-10 amplitude from the beam port geometry, both of which may have reduced the fusion neutron production and areal density.},

	abstract = {A major advantage of the laser direct-drive (DD) approach to ignition is the increased fraction of laser drive energy coupled to the hot spot and relaxed hot-spot requirements for the peak pressure and convergence ratios relative to the indirect-drive approach at equivalent laser energy. With the goal of a successful ignition demonstration using DD, the recently established national strategy has several elements and involves multiple national and international institutions. These elements include the experimental demonstration on OMEGA cryogenic implosions of hot-spot conditions relevant for ignition at MJ-scale energies available at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and developing an understanding of laser-plasma interactions and laser coupling using DD experiments on the NIF. DD designs require reaching central stagnation pressures in excess of 100 Gbar. The current experiments on OMEGA have achieved inferred peak pressures of 56 Gbar (Regan et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 025001). Extensive analysis of the cryogenic target experiments and two- and three-dimensional simulations suggest that power balance, target offset, and target quality are the main limiting factors in target performance. In addition, cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) has been identified as the main mechanism reducing laser coupling. Reaching the goal of demonstrating hydrodynamic equivalence on OMEGA includes improving laser power balance, target position, and target quality at shot time. CBET must also be significantly reduced and several strategies have been identified to address this issue.},

In this paper, the effects of asymmetric compression of cryogenic deuterium tritium laser-direct-drive implosions are examined using a suite of nuclear and x-ray diagnostics on the OMEGA laser. The neutron-averaged hot-spot velocity ({\textasciitilde}uhs) and apparent ion temperature (Ti) asymmetry are determined from neutron time-of-ﬂight measurements of the primary deuterium tritium fusion neutron energy spectrum, while the areal density (qR) of the compressed fuel surrounding the hot spot is inferred from measurements of the scattered neutron energy spectrum. The low-mode perturbations of the hot-spot shape are characterized from x-ray self-emission images recorded along three quasiorthogonal lines of sight. Implosions with signiﬁcant mode-1 laser-drive asymmetries show large hot-spot velocities ({\textgreater}100 km/s) in a direction consistent with the hot-spot elongation observed in x-ray images, measured Ti asymmetry, and qR asymmetry. Laser-drive corrections have been applied through shifting the initial target location in order to mitigate the observed asymmetry. With the asymmetry corrected, a more-symmetric hot spot is observed with reduced {\textasciitilde}uhs; Ti asymmetry, qR asymmetry, and a 30\% increase in the fusion yield.},

	abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion, pellets of deuterium tritium fuel are compressed and heated to the conditions where they undergo fusion and release energy. The target gain (ratio of energy released from the fusion reactions to the energy in the drive source) is a key parameter in determining the power flow and economics of an inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant. In this study, the physics of gain is explored for laser-direct-drive targets with driver energy at the megajoule scale. This analysis is performed with the assumption of next-generation laser technologies that are expected to increase convergent drive pressures to over 200 Mbar. This is possible with the addition of bandwidth to the laser spectrum and by employing focal-spot zooming. Simple physics arguments are used to derive scaling laws that describe target gain as a function of laser energy, adiabat, ablation pressure, and implosion velocity. Scaling laws are found for the unablated mass, ablation pressure, areal density, implosion velocity, and in-flight aspect ratio. Those scaling laws are then used to explore the design space for IFE targets.},

Scaling laws are derived for the stagnation values of the shell density and areal density and for the hot-spot pressure, temperature, and areal density. A simple formula is also derived for the thermonuclear energy gain and in-flight aspect ratio. Implosions of cryogenic deuterium-tritium capsules driven by UV laser energies ranging from 25kJto2MJ are simulated with a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code to generate the implosion database used in the scaling law derivation. These scaling laws provide guidelines for optimized fuel assembly and laser pulse design for direct-drive fast ignition and conventional inertial confinement fusion.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for interpreting the hot-spot electron temperature (Te) inferred from hard (10- to 20-keV) x-ray continuum emission for inertial conﬁnement fusion implosions on OMEGA. We ﬁrst show that the inferred Te represents the emission-weighted, harmonic mean of the hot-spot Te distribution, both spatially and temporally. A scheme is then provided for selecting a photon energy of which the emission weighting approximates neutron weighting. Simulations are then used to quantify the predicted relationship between the inferred Te, neutron-weighted Ti, and implosion performance on OMEGA. In an ensemble of 1-D simulations, it was observed that hot-spot thermal nonequilibrium precluded a sufﬁciently unique mapping between the inferred Te and neutron-weighted Ti. The inferred Te and hard x-ray yield’s sensitivity to implosion asymmetry was studied using a 3-D simulation case study with low-harmonicmode perturbations (i.e., laser beam power imbalance, target offset, and beam port geometry departures from spherical symmetry) and laser imprint (lmax ¼ 200).},

	abstract = {Models obtained through statistical analysis have demonstrated good predictive capability for the fusion yields of OMEGA cryogenic implosions. These models produced accurate correlations between the experimental fusion yields and several output variables from the 1-D radiation-hydrodynamic code LILAC. These statistical relations were used to design new implosion experiments, leading to tripling of the fusion yield on OMEGA. Here we describe how these statistical methods can be applied to predict other experimental observables including the areal density and hot-spot radius. These predictive correlations are then used to design new pulse shapes to increase the convergence ratio and the areal density for a new implosion campaign. Once an accurate predictive capability is established for both fusion yields and areal densities, it will be possible to design and field the optimum implosion compatible with the capabilities of the OMEGA laser. This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration under Award Number DE-NA0001944.

	abstract = {The kinematic lower bound for the single scattering of neutrons produced in deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion reactions produces a backscatter edge in the measured neutron spectrum. The energy spectrum of backscattered neutrons is dependent on the scattering ion velocity distribution. As the neutrons preferentially scatter in the densest regions of the capsule, the neutron backscatter edge presents a unique measurement of the hydrodynamic conditions in the dense DT fuel. It is shown that the spectral shape of the edge is determined by the scattering rate weighted ﬂuid velocity and temperature of the dense DT fuel layer during neutron production. In order to ﬁt the neutron spectrum, a model for the various backgrounds around the backscatter edge is developed and tested on synthetic data produced from hydrodynamic simulations of OMEGA implosions. It is determined that the analysis could be utilized on current inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments in order to measure the dense fuel properties.},

	abstract = {SpK is part of the numerical codebase at Imperial College London used to model high energy density physics (HEDP) experiments. SpK is an efficient atomic and microphysics code used to perform detailed configuration accounting calculations of electronic and ionic stage populations, opacities and emissivities for use in postprocessing and radiation hydrodynamics simulations. This is done using screened hydrogenic atomic data supplemented by the NIST energy level database. An extended Saha model solves for chemical equilibrium with extensions for non-ideal physics, such as ionisation potential depression, and non thermal equilibrium corrections. A tree-heap (treap) data structure is used to store spectral data, such as opacity, which is dynamic thus allowing easy insertion of points around spectral lines without a-priori knowledge of the ion stage populations. Results from SpK are compared to other codes and descriptions of radiation transport solutions which use SpK data are given. The treap data structure and SpK’s computational efficiency allows inline post-processing of 3D hydrodynamics simulations with a dynamically evolving spectrum stored in a treap.},

	abstract = {Radiative hydrodynamic simulations of implosion experiments on the OMEGA laser system [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] show that energy transfer between crossing laser beams can reduce laser absorption by 10\%–20\%. A new quantitative model for the crossed-beam energy transfer has been developed, allowing one to simulate the coupling of multiple beams in the expanding corona of implosion targets. Scattered-light and bang-time measurements show good agreement with predictions of this model when nonlocal heat transport is employed. The laser absorption can be increased by narrowing laser beams and/or employing two-color light, which both reduce the crossed-beam energy transfer.},
