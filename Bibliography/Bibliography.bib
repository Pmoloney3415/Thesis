	abstract = {Ray-based cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) models have become a common feature of the radiation-hydrodynamic codes used to simulate inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments. These models are necessary for achieving better agreement with experimental measurements, but their detailed implementation can vary widely between the codes and often rely on artiﬁcial multipliers. To address this, a series of 2D and 3D test cases has been developed with validated solutions from wave-based calculations. Comparisons of various ray-based CBET models to the wave-based calculations highlight the essential physics that is required for accurate ray-based CBET modeling. Quantitative comparison metrics and/or ﬁeld data from the wave-based calculations have been made available for use in the validation of other ray-based CBET codes.},

	abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion experiments are sensitive to cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that redistributes laser energy in the coronal plasma through self-generated ion acoustic wave (IAW) gratings. The detailed CBET coupling depends on the polarization state of the crossing wavefields. CBET itself can also scramble the beam polarizations by inducing ellipticity through the IAW grating, and rotating the seed polarization toward that of the pump. We develop a ray-based model that describes the polarized CBET coupling and that is compatible with the framework of 3D inline radiative hydrodynamics simulations. The model is implemented in the ASTER/IFRIIT code and verified against an academic test case and an offline polarized CBET post-processor. It is then applied to the detailed configuration of the distributed polarization rotator system on OMEGA, where results highlight how polarized CBET induces significant low modes in the collisional absorption source term. Finally, the modeling is applied to a simple indirect-drive configuration, comparing CBET calculations with 96 unpolarized or polarized beams with 24 unpolarized quads. It is shown that these cases produce similar power amplification per cone of beams grouped with similar polar angles. However, the 96 beam geometry itself is found to reduce azimuthal variations in quad power after the interaction and favors beams with larger polar angles within the cones, an effect that is amplified by the polarized CBET. Application of the model to inline calculations of OMEGA implosions are presented in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {We present the first 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of directly driven inertial confinement fusion implosions with an inline package for polarized crossed-beam energy transfer, which were used to assess the impact of the current distributed polarization rotators (DPRs) on OMEGA as well as other known sources of asymmetry. Applied to OMEGA implosions, the simulations predict bang times with no need for ad hoc multipliers, as well as yields—if you separately account for the impacts of imprint and fuel age. The magnitude of the flow is well reproduced when the low mode sources are large, whereas the modeling of the stalk is thought to be required to match the flow magnitude in the remaining cases. For the cases explored in more detail, polarized cross-beam energy transfer (CBET)—the only known systematic drive asymmetry, brought the results closest to the measured flow vectors. The remaining discrepancies are shown to be stemming from the limited knowledge of the laser pointing modes. For typical current levels of beam mispointing, power imbalance, target offset, and asymmetry caused by polarized CBET, low modes degrade the yield by more than 40\%. The current strategy of attempting to compensate the mode-1 asymmetry with a preimposed target offset recovers only about one-third of the losses caused by the low modes due to the dynamic nature of the multiple asymmetries and the presence of low modes other than l = 1. Therefore, addressing the root causes of the drive asymmetries is apt to be more beneficial. To that end, one possible solution to the specific issue of polarized CBET (10 µm DPRs) is shown to work well.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to efficiently model 3-D laser plasma interactions at fluid scales is presented. This method, implemented in the IFRIIT propagation code developed at CELIA, relies on inverse ray tracing to compute laser fields at arbitrary locations in a plasma. This enables to describe the fields at high order in space compared to standard forward ray tracing approaches. In addition, inverse ray tracing enables the use of etalon integral methods to reconstruct caustic fields and greatly speeds up calculations of cross-beam energy transfer by decoupling the ray amplitude and ray phase calculations. A comparison of the inverse and forward methods for 3-D calculations of fields in presence or not of cross-beam energy transfer illustrates the significant advantages of the inverse method. Conversely, while the inverse method is well suited to most spherical plasma profiles, it currently cannot treat concave profiles or target holders. The coupling of IFRIIT with the 3-D ASTER radiative hydrodynamics code developed at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics is then presented. ASTER and IFRIIT resolve their respective equations on separate grids which communicate through interpolation. As such, IFRIIT uses a dedicated laser grid adapted to the computations at play, which also allows to use different parallelization methods for both codes: block decomposition for the hydrodynamics versus domain duplication for the laser. Applications to direct-drive implosions for inertial confinement fusion are presented, for which a geodesic icosahedron grid is implemented in IFRIIT. The performances of the ASTER/IFRIIT coupling are demonstrated by conducting simulations of cryogenic implosions performed on the OMEGA laser system, in presence of various sources of 3-D effects; laser port geometry, cross-beam energy transfer, beam imbalance and target mis-alignment. Comparison with neutron data, measured through bang-time, for a cryogenic implosion experiment shows an excellent agreement for the laser-plasma coupling.},

	abstract = {The prediction that laser plasma heating distorts the electron distribution function away from Maxwellian and towards a super-Gaussian distribution dates back four decades1. In conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, however, no direct evidence of this so-called ‘Langdon effect’ has previously been observed. Here we present measurements of the spatially and temporally resolved Thomson scattering spectrum that indicate the presence of super-Gaussian electron distribution functions consistent with existing theory2. In such plasmas, ion acoustic wave frequencies increase monotonically with the super-Gaussian exponent3. Our results show that the measured power transfer between crossed laser beams mediated by ion acoustic waves requires a model that accounts for the non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, whereas the standard Maxwellian calculations overpredict power transfer over a wide region of parameter space. Including this effect is expected to improve the predictive capability of crossed-beam energy transfer modelling at the National Ignition Facility in California and may restore a larger operable design space for inertial confinement fusion experiments. This is also expected to motivate further inquiry in other areas affected by non-Maxwellian electron distribution functions, such as laser absorption, heat transport and X-ray spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {The compression of direct-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) targets is strongly impacted by cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that limits ablation pressure by redirecting laser energy outward and that is projected to be mitigated by laser bandwidth. Here, we explore various CBET mitigation constraints to guide the design of future ICF facilities. First, we ﬁnd that the ﬂat, Gaussian, and Lorentzian spectral shapes have similar CBET mitigation properties, and a ﬂat shape with nine spectral lines is a good surrogate for what can be obtained with other spectral shapes. Then, we conduct a comprehensive study across energy scales and ignition designs. 3D hydrodynamic simulations are used to derive an analytical model for the expected CBET mitigation as a function of laser and plasma parameters. From this model, we study the bandwidth requirements of conventional and shock ignition designs across four different energy scales and ﬁnd that they require between 0.5 and 3 6 0:2\% relative bandwidth. Best mitigation is achieved when the beam radius over critical radius Rb=Rc is kept low during the drive while the plasma temperature is kept high. In a steady state, we ﬁnd that the bandwidth required to mitigate 85\% of CBET scales as ðRb=RcÞ2:15LÀn 0:58I0:7, where Ln is the density scale length, and I the laser intensity. Finally, we ﬁnd that the chamber beam port layout does not inﬂuence CBET mitigation. In the case of a driver using many monochromatic beamlets, we ﬁnd that \$10 beamlets per port is required, with diminishing returns above \$20.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) results from two-beam energy exchange via seeded stimulated Brillouin scattering, which detrimentally reduces laser-energy absorption for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion. Consequently, ablation pressure and implosion velocity suffer from the decreased absorption, reducing target performance in both symmetric and polar direct drive. Additionally, CBET alters the time-resolved scattered-light spectra and redistributes absorbed and scattered-light–changing shell morphology and low-mode drive symmetry. Mitigating CBET is demonstrated in inertial confinement implosions at the National Ignition Facility by detuning the laser-source wavelengths (±2.3 Å UV) of the interacting beams. In polar direct drive, wavelength detuning was shown to increase the equatorial region velocity experimentally by 16\% and to alter the in-flight shell morphology. These experimental observations are consistent with design predictions of radiation–hydrodynamic simulations that indicate a 10\% increase in the average ablation pressure. These results indicate that wavelength detuning successfully mitigates CBET. Simulations predict that optimized phase plates and wavelength-detuning CBET mitigation utilizing the three-legged beam layout of the OMEGA Laser System significantly increase absorption and achieve \&gt;100-Gbar hot-spot pressures in symmetric direct drive.},

Each reﬁnement can be seen as a ﬁner grid in a multiple-grid system. The standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates using a multiple-grid system is detailed and an inadequacy in the method is presented. A new algorithm of particle to node weighting in a multiple-grid system is then described and compared to the standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates. This description pays particular attention to the nodes near the interface between grids of diﬀering cell-size. The volume weighting method used in this study is geometrically similar to the standard bilinear PIC method in Cartesian coordinates, but weights in proportion to the volumes of revolution of the areas about the z-axis, rather than the areas themselves. As the volume weighting method has the axisymmetric geometry built in, it is a natural system to use in this particular case. A full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of metal plasma-immersion ion implantation and deposition (MePIIID) of a ﬂat stage using three grids of cell size: 0.5 · 0.5, 1 · 1 and 2 · 2 mm; is performed and results are compared to those obtained from a single-grid simulation with the same parameters.

	abstract = {Understanding magnetised laser–plasma interactions is important for controlling magneto-inertial fusion experiments and developing magnetically assisted radiation and particle sources. For nanosecond pulses at non-relativistic intensities, interactions are dominated by coherent three-wave interactions, whose nonlinear coupling coefﬁcients became known only recently when waves propagate at oblique angles with the magnetic ﬁeld. In this paper, backscattering coupling coefﬁcients predicted by warm-ﬂuid theory are benchmarked using particle-in-cell simulations in one spatial dimension, and excellent agreements are found for a wide range of plasma temperatures, magnetic ﬁeld strengths and laser propagation angles, when the interactions are mediated by electron-dominant hybrid waves. Systematic comparisons between theory and simulations are made possible by a rigorous protocol. On the theory side, the initial boundary value problem of linearised three-wave equations is solved, and the transient-time solutions allow the effects of growth and damping to be distinguished. On the simulation side, parameters are carefully chosen and calibration runs are performed to ensure that comparisons are well controlled. Fitting simulation data to analytical solutions yields numerical growth rates that match theory predictions within error bars. Although warm-ﬂuid theory is found to be valid for a wide parameter range, genuine kinetic effects have also been observed.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) is thought to be responsible for a 30\% reduction in hydrodynamic coupling efficiency on OMEGA and up to 50\% at the ignition scale for direct-drive (DD) implosions. These numbers are determined by ray-based models that have been developed and integrated within the radiation–hydrodynamics codes LILAC (1-D) and DRACO (2-D). However, ray-based modeling of CBET in an inhomogeneous plasma assumes a steady-state plasma response, does not include the effects of beam speckle, and treats ray caustics in an ad hoc manner. The validity of the modeling for ignition-scale implosions has not yet been determined. To address the physics shortcomings, which have important implications for DD inertial confinement fusion, a new wave-based model has been developed. It solves the time-enveloped Maxwell equations in three dimensions, including polarization effects, plasma inhomogeneity, and open-boundary conditions with the ability to prescribe beams incident at arbitrary angles. Beams can be made realistic with respect to laser speckle, polarization smoothing, and laser bandwidth. This, coupled to a linearized low-frequency plasma response that does not assume a steady state, represents the most-complete model of CBET to date.},

	abstract = {The performance of direct-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion implosions relies critically on the coupling of laser energy to the target plasma. Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), the resonant exchange of energy between intersecting laser beams mediated by ponderomotively driven ion-acoustic waves (IAWs), inhibits this coupling by scattering light into unwanted directions. The variety of beam intersection angles and varying plasma conditions in an implosion results in IAWs with a range of phase velocities. Here, we show that CBET saturates through a resonance detuning that depends on the IAW phase velocity and that results from trapping-induced modiﬁcations to the ion distribution functions. For smaller phase velocities, the modiﬁcations to the distribution functions can rapidly thermalize in the presence of mid-Z ions, leading to a blueshift in the resonant frequency. For larger phase velocities, the modiﬁcations can persist, leading to a redshift in the resonant frequency. Ultimately, these results may reveal pathways toward CBET mitigation and inform reduced models for radiation hydrodynamics codes to improve their predictive capability.},

We choose laser and plasma conditions for the simulations that are favorable to CBET and promote nonlinearity. Through a comparison of outputs from the particle-in-cell code vector particle in cell (VPIC) and the linearized fluid code laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE), a series of nonlinear effects have been identified in the kinetic simulations that include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion-acoustic wave self-focusing. These effects produce time-dependent energy transfer, in contrast to the linearized fluid simulations in which a steady state is reached after an initial transient. Ion trapping is shown to allow for increased energy transfer relative to fluid simulations, with the remaining nonlinear processes acting to reduce the energy transfer. Nonlinear dynamics is contrasted for low- and high-intensity beams as well as between speckled and planar beams. For the parameters under consideration, beam profile has a significant effect on nonlinear dynamics, though the greatest sensitivity is to beam intensity.},

Existing linear theory is generalized to treat broadband lasers, demonstrating that CBET is most effectively suppressed when the bandwidth exceeds the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) frequency. It is shown that for such bandwidths, reverse (seed to pump) transfer becomes possible, which reduces the net energy transfer rapidly as bandwidth is increased. The CBET gain exponent in this regime scales with bandwidth (Δω) as Δω−3 for Gaussian or Lorentzian laser spectra with different scalings possible for other spectra. Comparison of our theory with linearized fluid and particle-in-cell simulations, performed with the laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE) and vector particle in cell (VPIC) codes, respectively, finds that the model is accurate in the absence of nonlinear processes. However, linear analysis also finds that the IAW energy density scales as Δω−1, implying that nonlinear effects may be more difficult to control than the CBET scaling would suggest. Indeed, nonlinear effects are found to be present in VPIC simulations with high-intensity lasers, despite minimal apparent CBET. Nonlinear processes in the VPIC cases include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion wave self-focusing. In some high intensity VPIC cases, these effects lead to net energy transfer from seed to pump and increases to backscatter stimulated Brillouin scattering reflectivities. Finally, for a given bandwidth, we show that improved control of nonlinear processes can be achieved via smoothing by spectral dispersion.},

            Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The energy density of these fields is typically comparable to the energy density of the fluid motions of the plasma in which they are embedded, making magnetic fields essential players in the dynamics of the luminous matter. The standard theoretical model for the origin of these strong magnetic fields is through the amplification of tiny seed fields via turbulent dynamo to the level consistent with current observations. However, experimental demonstration of the turbulent dynamo mechanism has remained elusive, since it requires plasma conditions that are extremely hard to re-create in terrestrial laboratories. Here we demonstrate, using laser-produced colliding plasma flows, that turbulence is indeed capable of rapidly amplifying seed fields to near equipartition with the turbulent fluid motions. These results support the notion that turbulent dynamo is a viable mechanism responsible for the observed present-day magnetization.},

	abstract = {Astrophysical collisionless shocks are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. Generated by violent interactions of supersonic plasma flows with the interstellar medium, supernova remnant shocks are observed to amplify magnetic fields1 and accelerate electrons and protons to highly relativistic speeds2–4. In the well-established model of diffusive shock acceleration5, relativistic particles are accelerated by repeated shock crossings. However, this requires a separate mechanism that pre-accelerates particles to enable shock crossing. This is known as the ‘injection problem’, which is particularly relevant for electrons, and remains one of the most important puzzles in shock acceleration6. In most astrophysical shocks, the details of the shock structure cannot be directly resolved, making it challenging to identify the injection mechanism. Here we report results from laser-driven plasma flow experiments, and related simulations, that probe the formation of turbulent collisionless shocks in conditions relevant to young supernova remnants. We show that electrons can be effectively accelerated in a first-order Fermi process by small-scale turbulence produced within the shock transition to relativistic non-thermal energies, helping overcome the injection problem. Our observations provide new insight into electron injection at shocks and open the way for controlled laboratory studies of the physics underlying cosmic accelerators. In laser–plasma experiments complemented by simulations, electron acceleration is observed in turbulent collisionless shocks. This work clarifies the pre-acceleration to relativistic energies required for the onset of diffusive shock acceleration.},

However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly collisional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in galaxy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a system in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a reduction of heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading to large temperature variations on small spatial scales (as is seen in cluster plasmas).

A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study α-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Irradiating a small capsule containing deuterium and tritium fuel directly with intense laser light causes it to implode, which creates a plasma hot enough to initiate fusion reactions between the fuel nuclei. Here we report on such laser direct-drive experiments and observe that the fusion reactions produce more energy than the amount of energy in the central so-called hot-spot plasma. This condition is identified as having a hot-spot fuel gain greater than unity. A hot-spot fuel gain of around four was previously accomplished at the National Ignition Facility in indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments where the capsule is irradiated by X-rays. In that case, up to 1.9 MJ of laser energy was used, but in contrast, our experiments on the OMEGA laser system require as little as 28 kJ. As the hot-spot fuel gain is predicted to grow with laser energy and target size, our work establishes the direct-drive approach to inertial fusion as a promising path towards burning and ignited plasmas in the laboratory. Additionally, we report a record (direct-drive) fusion yield of 0.9 kJ on OMEGA, which we achieved with thin-ice deuterium–tritium liner targets.},

The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser–plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 μm—the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser—and 0.248 μm (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon–decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts.

Different assumptions underlie previous analytic frameworks that provide predictions for wavelength scaling of many important target parameters. These are explored and compared to radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of laser-driven targets. We are particularly interested here in lasers with wavelengths between 0:193 lm [wavelength of the Argon Flouride (ArF) excimer laser] and 0:527 lm (the frequency-doubled glass Nd:glass laser). Shortwavelength drivers have signiﬁcant advantages for directly driven ICF targets, which are summarized here. We show that constraints such as providing a certain pressure or avoiding laser-plasma instability thresholds allow shorter laser wavelengths to provide energy savings, pressure enhancements, and/or higher hydrodynamic efﬁciencies. We also consider potential disadvantages, such as increased laser imprint or exposure to the Landau–Darrieus instability. These are shown to be either minor and/or can be easily remediated.},

Short-wavelength drivers have significant advantages, primarily in using less power and energy to drive targets. Additionally, they expand the allowed operating regime that is constrained by LPI avoidance and the production of higher pressures needed for more hydrodynamically stable targets.

The paraxial complex geometrical optics (PCGO) is adapted for light waves in an inhomogeneous medium and modified to include the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption and the ponderomotive force. This thick-ray model is compared to the standard ray-tracing (RT) approach, both in the chic code. The PCGO model leads to different power deposition patterns and better diffraction modeling compared to standard RT codes. The intensity-reconstruction technique used in RT codes to model nonlinear LPI leads to artificial filamentation and fails to reproduce realistic ponderomotive self-focusing distances, intensity amplifications, and density channel depletions, whereas PCGO succeeds. Bundles of Gaussian thick rays can be used to model realistic non-Gaussian ICF beams. The PCGO approach is expected to improve the accuracy of ICF simulations and serve as a basis to implement diverse LPI effects in large-scale hydrocodes.},

	abstract = {Indirect drive inertial confinement fusion experiments with convergence ratios below 17 have been previously shown to be less susceptible to Rayleigh–Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities, making this regime highly interesting for fusion science. Additional limitations imposed on the implosion velocity, in-flight aspect ratio and applied laser power aim to further reduce instability growth, resulting in a new regime where performance can be well represented by one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic simulations. A simulation campaign was performed using the 1D radiation-hydrodynamics code HYADES to investigate the performance that could be achieved using direct-drive implosions of liquid layer capsules, over a range of relevant energies. Results include potential gains of 0.19 on LMJ-scale systems and 0.75 on NIF-scale systems, and a reactor-level gain of 54 for an 8.5 MJ implosion. While the use of 1D simulations limits the accuracy of these results, they indicate a sufficiently high level of performance to warrant further investigations and verification of this new low-instability regime. This potentially suggests an attractive new approach to fusion energy.

	abstract = {A 3-D ray based model for computing laser ﬁelds in dissipative and amplifying media is presented. The eikonal equation is solved using inverse ray-tracing on a dedicated nonstructured 3-D mesh. Inverse ray-tracing opens the possibility of using Complex Geometrical Optics (CGO), for which we propose a propagation formalism in a ﬁnite element mesh. Divergent ﬁelds at caustics are corrected using an etalon integral method for fold-type caustics. This method is successfully applied in dissipative media by modifying the ray-ordering and root selection rules, thereby allowing one to reconstruct the ﬁeld in the entire caustic region. In addition, we demonstrate how caustics in the CGO framework can disappear entirely for sufﬁciently dissipative media, making the complex ray approach valid in the entire medium. CGO is shown to offer a more precise modeling of laser refraction and absorption in a dissipative medium when compared to Geometrical Optics (GO). In the framework of Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion (ICF), this occurs mostly at intermediate temperatures or at high temperatures close to the critical density. Additionally, GO is invalid at low temperatures if an approximated expression of the permittivity is used. The inverse ray-tracing algorithm for GO and CGO is implemented in the IFRIIT code, in the framework of a dielectric permittivity described in 3-D using a piecewise linear approximation in tetrahedrons. Fields computed using GO and CGO are compared to results from the electromagnetic wave solver Laser Plasma Simulation Environment. Excellent agreement is obtained in 1-D linear and nonlinear permittivity proﬁles. Good agreement is also obtained for ICF-like Gaussian density proﬁles in 2-D. Finally, we demonstrate how the model reproduces Gaussian beam diffraction using CGO. The IFRIIT code will be interfaced inline to 3-D radiative hydrodynamic codes to describe the nonlinear laser plasma interaction in ICF and high-energy-density plasmas.},

	abstract = {Integrated hydrodynamics simulations of inertial conﬁnement fusion rely on reduced physics models. To reproduce experimental trends, these models often feature tuning parameters, but this comes with a risk: the over-tuning of one model can hide physics inadequacies in another. The ray-based models of cross-beam-energy transfer (CBET) represent this risk. Here, we present an accurate and efﬁcient model of CBET suitable for inline implementation in 3D hydrodynamics simulations. Inverse Ray Tracing (IRT) is used to compute the ray ﬁeld in a 3D permittivity proﬁle described on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh using the Inline Field Reconstruction and Interaction using Inverse Tracing framework. CBET is accounted for through perturbations to the permittivity associated with ion acoustic waves driven by the overlapped ﬁelds. Large gradients in the permittivity are resolved by coupling the IRT to a recursive Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement (AMR) algorithm. The use of AMR also allows for the resolution of caustics, with accurate ﬁeld reconstruction performed using the Etalon integral method. Comparisons of the model with wave-based solutions from the Laser Plasma Simulation Environment demonstrate its ability to control energy conservation and gain convergence through the AMR depth only, without the use of ad hoc physical models or artiﬁcial tuning parameters.},

The target consisted of a gold vacuum rugby-shaped hohlraum and a plastic capsule located at its center, filled with deuterium gas fuel. The arrangement of the 12 quads is such that the laser irradiation on the wall generated a three-dimensional (3D) x-ray flux around the capsule creating 3D deformations on the imploding plastic shell. This constraint forced the design of a robust target (relatively thin ablator, around 40 lm) driven by a short laser pulse (3 ns) that delivered about 1011 neutrons. Full-integrated 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations allowed both the target definition and the data interpretation (mainly radiation temperature, x-ray images, and neutron yield). 3D calculations and experiments compare well.},

These energy exchanges and scatterings are described by a Monte Carlo method simulating the creation/annihilation of rays. The algorithm has been validated against other numerical solvers and, in the case of CBET, by means of kinetic simulations. The method is efﬁcient and can be easily implemented in already existing ray tracing packages used in many hydrodynamic codes.

	abstract = {The Crossed Beam Energy Transfer (CBET) of two large laser beams is modeled using two approaches: (i) the time-independent Paraxial Complex Geometrical Optics (PCGO) for stochastically distributed Gaussian-shaped beamlets and (ii) the time-dependent conventional paraxial propagation of smoothed laser beams. Each description of the laser propagation is coupled to a hydrodynamics code. Both approaches are compared in a well-defined plasma configuration with density- and velocity- profiles corresponding to an inhomogeneous plasma, including a resonance zone in which the matching conditions for a resonant coupling between the two laser beams are fulfilled. The comparison is made for laser beams smoothed by random phase plates and for “regular beams” without speckles. The role of the laser speckles is also investigated for each approach. In general, a good agreement is found between the PCGO simulations and the fully time-dependent paraxial-type simulations, carried out with the code Harmony, past a transient period on the picosecond time scale. The PCGO-based CBET model is applied to the hydrodynamics simulations of a CBET experiment, the results of which reproduce essential features of the experimental data. Based on these comparisons, performed for interaction parameters up to 2×1014W cm−2μm2, the PCGO approach proves to be a reliable method to be implemented in the hydrodynamics codes to describe the CBET in mm-scale plasmas.},

	abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion, pellets of deuterium tritium fuel are compressed and heated to the conditions where they undergo fusion and release energy. The target gain (ratio of energy released from the fusion reactions to the energy in the drive source) is a key parameter in determining the power flow and economics of an inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant. In this study, the physics of gain is explored for laser-direct-drive targets with driver energy at the megajoule scale. This analysis is performed with the assumption of next-generation laser technologies that are expected to increase convergent drive pressures to over 200 Mbar. This is possible with the addition of bandwidth to the laser spectrum and by employing focal-spot zooming. Simple physics arguments are used to derive scaling laws that describe target gain as a function of laser energy, adiabat, ablation pressure, and implosion velocity. Scaling laws are found for the unablated mass, ablation pressure, areal density, implosion velocity, and in-flight aspect ratio. Those scaling laws are then used to explore the design space for IFE targets.},

Results with low-mode asymmetries are used to estimate the magnitude of anisotropy in the neutron spectra shift, width, and shape. Comparisons of primary and down scattered images highlight the lack of alignment between the neutron sources, scatter sites, and detector plane, which limits the ability to infer the ρr of the fuel from a down scattered ratio. Further calculations use high bandwidth multi-mode perturbations to induce multiple short scale length flows in the hotspot. The results indicate that the effect of fluid velocity is to produce a DT neutron spectrum with an apparently higher temperature than that inferred from the DD spectrum and which is also higher than the temperature implied by the DT to DD yield ratio.},

It is simple in construction and use, and provides more uniform width of the latitudinal rings than other methods of equal-area pixelization of a spherical surface. The new method provides rectangular grid cells with latitude- and longitude-oriented boundaries, near-square cells in the equatorial rings, and the closest to uniform width of the latitudinal rings as compared with other equal-area isolatitudinal grids. The binned data is easy to visualize and interpret in terms of the longitude–latitude rectangular coordinate system, natural for astronomy and geodesy. Grids with an arbitrary number of rings and, consequently, a wide and theoretically unlimited range of cell size can be built by the proposed method. Comparison with other methods used in astronomical research showed the advantages of the new approach in the sense of uniformity of the ring width, a wider range of grid resolution, and simplicity of use.},

	abstract = {Eigensolutions of the spherical Laplacian operator on the cubed‐sphere and the icosahedral (‐hexagonal) grid were investigated. For the cubed‐sphere grid, the Laplacian operator was discretized with the Spectral Element Method (SEM) using the Lagrange–Legendre Polynomials (LLP), while, for the icosahedral grid, the Finite Difference Method (FDM) was employed. The discrete Laplacian operator was formulated into matrix equations with respect to the unknowns of the global‐domain grid‐point values. The eigenvalues of the matrix exhibited a step‐function‐like behaviour: there are 2
              n
              + 1 identical (degenerate) eigenvalues for the degree
              n
              , the total wave‐number‐like index. Unlike the spherical harmonic functions, the eigenvectors were found to be not separable into zonal and meridional structure: a part of them reflected the basic geometry of grids, i.e. the cube (icosahedron) for the cubed‐sphere (icosahedral) grid. These eigenvectors were shown to consist of only a couple of spherical harmonics. The eigensolutions indicated that the Rossby–Haurwitz waves, the normal modes of absolute‐vorticity conserving motion, are affected significantly by the underlying grid system in both horizontal structure (resulting in geodesic Rossby–Haurwitz waves) and phase speed (being larger than theory for the cubed‐sphere SEM, but smaller for the icosahedral FDM). It was implied by the eigensolutions that when a prognostic equation incorporates Laplacian‐type hyperviscosity, the maximum viscosity coefficient for the cubed‐sphere SEM should be given significantly smaller than for the icosahedral FDM, particularly in the case of high resolution with the high‐order LLP. Selective filtering or diffusing small‐scales was revealed to be practiced more effectively for the cubed‐sphere SEM than the icosahedral FDM. The eigenvectors are also discussed in relation to the grid imprinting of the numerical models built on those geodesic grids.},

	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

	abstract = {A mesh of nodes used in particle-in-cell simulations may be reﬁned in some regions to obtain better local spatial resolution without adding excessive computational cost. Each reﬁnement can be seen as a ﬁner grid in a multiple-grid system. The standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates using a multiple-grid system is detailed and an inadequacy in the method is presented. A new algorithm of particle to node weighting in a multiple-grid system is then described and compared to the standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates. This description pays particular attention to the nodes near the interface between grids of diﬀering cell-size. The volume weighting method used in this study is geometrically similar to the standard bilinear PIC method in Cartesian coordinates, but weights in proportion to the volumes of revolution of the areas about the z-axis, rather than the areas themselves. As the volume weighting method has the axisymmetric geometry built in, it is a natural system to use in this particular case. A full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of metal plasma-immersion ion implantation and deposition (MePIIID) of a ﬂat stage using three grids of cell size: 0.5 · 0.5, 1 · 1 and 2 · 2 mm; is performed and results are compared to those obtained from a single-grid simulation with the same parameters. The multiple grid method compares very well to the single-grid simulation.},

At sufficiently high intensities (≊1014 W/cm2) the gas is ionized and heated by a laser absorption wave propagating faster than the sound speed. For pulses under 2 ns, the bulk of the plasma remains stationary, resulting in efficient heating minimizing density and velocity gradients, which are particularly important for instability thresholds in nonuniform plasmas. The propagation of a laser absorption wave in a preionized plasma is derived analytically. Ionization resulting from multiphoton and electron avalanche processes is studied by numerical methods and dimensional analysis. This establishes the length and time scales over which an absorption wave can be observed. Computer simulations, using the lasnex code, are presented for several implementations of this concept, applicable to the relevant regime for inertial confinement fusion. These examples include a gas jet (≊3×1 mm in cross section), 3 to 4 mm diameter gas balloons, and gas puffs generated by exploding a foil with a low-energy prepulse (≊200 J).},

The ray-based models assume locally plane-wave laser beams and polarization-averaged incoherence between laser speckles for beams with polarization smoothing. The impact of beam speckle and polarization smoothing on CBET are studied using the 3-D wave-based laser–plasma interaction code LPSE. The results indicate that ray-based models underpredict CBET when the assumption of spatially averaged longitudinal incoherence across the CBET interaction region is violated. A model for CBET between linearly polarized speckled beams is presented that uses ray tracing to solve for the real speckle pattern of the unperturbed laser beams within the eikonal approximation and gives excellent agreement with the wave-based calculations. OMEGA-scale 2-D LPSE calculations using ICF-relevant plasma conditions suggest that the impact of beam speckle on laser absorption calculations in ICF implosions is small (\&lt;1\%).},

	abstract = {Low-mode asymmetries have emerged as one of the primary challenges to achieving high-performing inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) implosions. In direct-drive ICF, an important potential seed of such asymmetries is the capsule stalk mount, the impact of which has remained a contentious question. In this paper, we describe the results from an experiment on the OMEGA laser with intentional offsets at varying angles to the capsule stalk mount, which clearly demonstrates the impact of the stalk mount on implosion dynamics. The angle between stalk and offset is found to signiﬁcantly impact observables. Speciﬁcally, a larger directional ﬂow is observed in neutron spectrum measurements when the offset is toward rather than away from the stalk, while an offset at 42  to the stalk gives minimal directional ﬂow but still generates a large ﬂow ﬁeld in the implosion. No signiﬁcant directional ﬂow is seen due to stalk only. Time-integrated x-ray images support these ﬂow observations. A trend is also seen in implosion yield, with lower yield obtained for offsets with a smaller angle than with a larger angle toward the stalk. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations using 2D DRACO and 2D/3D Chimera not including the stalk mount and using 2D xRAGE including the stalk mount are brought to bear on the data. The yield trend, the minimal directional ﬂow with stalk only, and the larger ﬂow enhancement observed with the offset toward the stalk are all reproduced in the xRAGE simulations. The results strongly indicate that the stalk impact must be considered and mitigated to achieve high-performing implosions.},

	abstract = {The effects of two types of target mounts, stalks and spider silks, on the implosion of both room-temperature D2-gas-filled shells and cryogenic D2-ice-filled shells have been studied both experimentally and by means of two-dimensional simulations. The simulations indicate that the hydrodynamic effect of the expanding plasma created by the ablation of material from the target mounts and refraction of laser light by this plasma induce perturbations in the imploding shell that are damaging to the implosion. The spider silks are the more-damaging type of mount since the silks (typically four) are arrayed over the target surface, whereas the stalk (typically one) meets the target at a single point. Stalks are therefore preferred over silks as a target mount. The scale and magnitude of the perturbations induced by the spider silks have been verified by planar-target experiments performed on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly, D. L. Brown, R. S. Craxton et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1995)]. The perturbations predicted by simulations to arise from stalks qualitatively agree with the results of implosion experiments using Ti-doped plastic shells.},

Sources of these nonuniformities include an illumination pattern produced by 60 OMEGA laser beams, capsule offsets (∼10–20 μm), and imperfect pointing, power balance, and timing of the beams (with typical σrms∼10 μm, 10\%, and 5 ps, respectively). Two implosion designs using 26-kJ triple-picket laser pulses were studied: a nominal design, in which an 874-μm-diameter capsule is illuminated by about the same-diameter beams, and a more hydrodynamically efficient “R75” design using a 900-μm-diameter capsule and beams of 75\% of this diameter. Simulations show that nonuniformities caused by capsule offsets and beam imbalance have the largest effect on implosion performance. These nonuniformities lead to significant distortions of implosion cores, resulting in an increased residual kinetic energy and incomplete stagnation. The shape of distorted cores can be well characterized using neutron images but is less represented by 4–8 keV x-ray images. Simulated neutron spectra from perturbed implosions show large directional variations because of bulk motion effects and up to an ∼2 keV variation of the hot-spot temperature inferred from these spectra. The R75 design suffers more from illumination nonuniformities. Simulations show an advantage of this design over the nominal design when the target offset and beam power imbalance σrms are reduced to less than 5 μm and 5\%, respectively.},

This appears to be due to crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) that involves electromagnetic-seeded, low-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering. CBET scatters energy from the central portion of the incoming light beam to outgoing light, reducing the laser absorption and hydrodynamic efficiency of implosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including CBET show good agreement with all observables in implosion experiments on OMEGA. Three strategies to mitigate CBET and improve laser coupling are considered: the use of narrow beams, multicolor lasers, and higher-Z ablators. Experiments on OMEGA using narrow beams have demonstrated improvements in implosion performance.},

	abstract = {The optimization of radio frequency-wave (RF) systems for fusion experiments is often performed using ray-tracing codes, which rely on the geometrical-optics (GO) approximation. However, GO fails at caustics such as cutoffs and focal points, erroneously predicting the wave intensity to be inﬁnite. This is a critical shortcoming of GO, since the caustic wave intensity is often the quantity of interest, e.g., RF heating. Full-wave modeling can be used instead, but the computational cost limits the speed at which such optimizations can be performed. We have developed a less expensive alternative called metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO). Instead of evolving waves in the usual x (coordinate) or k (spectral) representation, MGO uses a mixed X   Ax þ Bk representation. By continuously adjusting the matrix coefﬁcients A and B along the rays, one can ensure that GO remains valid in the X coordinates without caustic singularities. The caustic-free result is then mapped back onto the original x space using metaplectic transforms. Here, we overview the MGO theory and review algorithms that will aid the development of an MGO-based ray-tracing code. We show how using orthosymplectic transformations leads to considerable simpliﬁcations compared to previously published MGO formulas. We also prove explicitly that MGO exactly reproduces standard GO when evaluated far from caustics (an important property that until now has only been inferred from numerical simulations), and we relate MGO to other semiclassical caustic-removal schemes published in the literature. This discussion is then augmented by an explicit comparison of the computed spectrum for a wave bounded between two cutoffs.},

If a pencil of light has geometric mean cross section size of the order p times the wavelength, it can propagate independently to a distance p2 times the wavelength, where most of the beam energy diﬀuses out of the beam region. This is consistent with a statement that van de Hulst made in a classical text on light scattering. The electromagnetic near ﬁelds in the pencil of light are not uniform, have complicated patterns within short distances from the beam base, and the ﬁelds tend to converge to Fraunhofer diﬀraction ﬁelds far away from the base.},

As large amounts of power are transferred between laser beams at the entrance holes of NIF hohlraums, the presence of many overlapping beat waves can lead to stochastic ion heating in the regions where laser beams overlap [P. Michel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 195004 (2012)]. This increases the ion acoustic velocity and modifies the ion acoustic waves’ dispersion relation, thus reducing the plasma response to the beat waves and the efficiency of CBET. This pushes the plasma oscillations driven by CBET in a regime where the phase velocities are much smaller than both the electron and ion thermal velocities. CBET gains are derived for this new regime and generalized to the case of multi ion species plasmas.},

In addition, some useful results are obtained analytically from expansions of the kinetic dispersion relation and from fluid models. However, these results disagree with the numerical results in domains of particular practical interest. When ion temperatures exceed two-tenths of the electron temperature, the least damped mode is the one with the smaller phase velocity, and this mode is then found to dominate the ponderomotive response of the CH plasma.},

The hydrodynamic efﬁciency, deﬁned as the ratio of the kinetic energy in the imploding shell to the laser energy, increased from 4.5\% to 5.0\% based on radiation-hydrodynamic calculations benchmarked to shell trajectory and bang-time measurements. The higher coupling came with a trade-off of an increased hot-electron production as well as increased hydrodynamic instabilities seeded by a larger mode-10 amplitude from the beam port geometry, both of which may have reduced the fusion neutron production and areal density.},

	abstract = {A major advantage of the laser direct-drive (DD) approach to ignition is the increased fraction of laser drive energy coupled to the hot spot and relaxed hot-spot requirements for the peak pressure and convergence ratios relative to the indirect-drive approach at equivalent laser energy. With the goal of a successful ignition demonstration using DD, the recently established national strategy has several elements and involves multiple national and international institutions. These elements include the experimental demonstration on OMEGA cryogenic implosions of hot-spot conditions relevant for ignition at MJ-scale energies available at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and developing an understanding of laser-plasma interactions and laser coupling using DD experiments on the NIF. DD designs require reaching central stagnation pressures in excess of 100 Gbar. The current experiments on OMEGA have achieved inferred peak pressures of 56 Gbar (Regan et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 025001). Extensive analysis of the cryogenic target experiments and two- and three-dimensional simulations suggest that power balance, target offset, and target quality are the main limiting factors in target performance. In addition, cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) has been identified as the main mechanism reducing laser coupling. Reaching the goal of demonstrating hydrodynamic equivalence on OMEGA includes improving laser power balance, target position, and target quality at shot time. CBET must also be significantly reduced and several strategies have been identified to address this issue.},

In this paper, the effects of asymmetric compression of cryogenic deuterium tritium laser-direct-drive implosions are examined using a suite of nuclear and x-ray diagnostics on the OMEGA laser. The neutron-averaged hot-spot velocity ({\textasciitilde}uhs) and apparent ion temperature (Ti) asymmetry are determined from neutron time-of-ﬂight measurements of the primary deuterium tritium fusion neutron energy spectrum, while the areal density (qR) of the compressed fuel surrounding the hot spot is inferred from measurements of the scattered neutron energy spectrum. The low-mode perturbations of the hot-spot shape are characterized from x-ray self-emission images recorded along three quasiorthogonal lines of sight. Implosions with signiﬁcant mode-1 laser-drive asymmetries show large hot-spot velocities ({\textgreater}100 km/s) in a direction consistent with the hot-spot elongation observed in x-ray images, measured Ti asymmetry, and qR asymmetry. Laser-drive corrections have been applied through shifting the initial target location in order to mitigate the observed asymmetry. With the asymmetry corrected, a more-symmetric hot spot is observed with reduced {\textasciitilde}uhs; Ti asymmetry, qR asymmetry, and a 30\% increase in the fusion yield.},

	abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion, pellets of deuterium tritium fuel are compressed and heated to the conditions where they undergo fusion and release energy. The target gain (ratio of energy released from the fusion reactions to the energy in the drive source) is a key parameter in determining the power flow and economics of an inertial fusion energy (IFE) power plant. In this study, the physics of gain is explored for laser-direct-drive targets with driver energy at the megajoule scale. This analysis is performed with the assumption of next-generation laser technologies that are expected to increase convergent drive pressures to over 200 Mbar. This is possible with the addition of bandwidth to the laser spectrum and by employing focal-spot zooming. Simple physics arguments are used to derive scaling laws that describe target gain as a function of laser energy, adiabat, ablation pressure, and implosion velocity. Scaling laws are found for the unablated mass, ablation pressure, areal density, implosion velocity, and in-flight aspect ratio. Those scaling laws are then used to explore the design space for IFE targets.},

Scaling laws are derived for the stagnation values of the shell density and areal density and for the hot-spot pressure, temperature, and areal density. A simple formula is also derived for the thermonuclear energy gain and in-flight aspect ratio. Implosions of cryogenic deuterium-tritium capsules driven by UV laser energies ranging from 25kJto2MJ are simulated with a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code to generate the implosion database used in the scaling law derivation. These scaling laws provide guidelines for optimized fuel assembly and laser pulse design for direct-drive fast ignition and conventional inertial confinement fusion.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for interpreting the hot-spot electron temperature (Te) inferred from hard (10- to 20-keV) x-ray continuum emission for inertial conﬁnement fusion implosions on OMEGA. We ﬁrst show that the inferred Te represents the emission-weighted, harmonic mean of the hot-spot Te distribution, both spatially and temporally. A scheme is then provided for selecting a photon energy of which the emission weighting approximates neutron weighting. Simulations are then used to quantify the predicted relationship between the inferred Te, neutron-weighted Ti, and implosion performance on OMEGA. In an ensemble of 1-D simulations, it was observed that hot-spot thermal nonequilibrium precluded a sufﬁciently unique mapping between the inferred Te and neutron-weighted Ti. The inferred Te and hard x-ray yield’s sensitivity to implosion asymmetry was studied using a 3-D simulation case study with low-harmonicmode perturbations (i.e., laser beam power imbalance, target offset, and beam port geometry departures from spherical symmetry) and laser imprint (lmax ¼ 200).},

	abstract = {Models obtained through statistical analysis have demonstrated good predictive capability for the fusion yields of OMEGA cryogenic implosions. These models produced accurate correlations between the experimental fusion yields and several output variables from the 1-D radiation-hydrodynamic code LILAC. These statistical relations were used to design new implosion experiments, leading to tripling of the fusion yield on OMEGA. Here we describe how these statistical methods can be applied to predict other experimental observables including the areal density and hot-spot radius. These predictive correlations are then used to design new pulse shapes to increase the convergence ratio and the areal density for a new implosion campaign. Once an accurate predictive capability is established for both fusion yields and areal densities, it will be possible to design and field the optimum implosion compatible with the capabilities of the OMEGA laser. This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration under Award Number DE-NA0001944.

	abstract = {The kinematic lower bound for the single scattering of neutrons produced in deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion reactions produces a backscatter edge in the measured neutron spectrum. The energy spectrum of backscattered neutrons is dependent on the scattering ion velocity distribution. As the neutrons preferentially scatter in the densest regions of the capsule, the neutron backscatter edge presents a unique measurement of the hydrodynamic conditions in the dense DT fuel. It is shown that the spectral shape of the edge is determined by the scattering rate weighted ﬂuid velocity and temperature of the dense DT fuel layer during neutron production. In order to ﬁt the neutron spectrum, a model for the various backgrounds around the backscatter edge is developed and tested on synthetic data produced from hydrodynamic simulations of OMEGA implosions. It is determined that the analysis could be utilized on current inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments in order to measure the dense fuel properties.},

	abstract = {SpK is part of the numerical codebase at Imperial College London used to model high energy density physics (HEDP) experiments. SpK is an efficient atomic and microphysics code used to perform detailed configuration accounting calculations of electronic and ionic stage populations, opacities and emissivities for use in postprocessing and radiation hydrodynamics simulations. This is done using screened hydrogenic atomic data supplemented by the NIST energy level database. An extended Saha model solves for chemical equilibrium with extensions for non-ideal physics, such as ionisation potential depression, and non thermal equilibrium corrections. A tree-heap (treap) data structure is used to store spectral data, such as opacity, which is dynamic thus allowing easy insertion of points around spectral lines without a-priori knowledge of the ion stage populations. Results from SpK are compared to other codes and descriptions of radiation transport solutions which use SpK data are given. The treap data structure and SpK’s computational efficiency allows inline post-processing of 3D hydrodynamics simulations with a dynamically evolving spectrum stored in a treap.},

Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] show that energy transfer between crossing laser beams can reduce laser absorption by 10\%–20\%. A new quantitative model for the crossed-beam energy transfer has been developed, allowing one to simulate the coupling of multiple beams in the expanding corona of implosion targets. Scattered-light and bang-time measurements show good agreement with predictions of this model when nonlocal heat transport is employed. The laser absorption can be increased by narrowing laser beams and/or employing two-color light, which both reduce the crossed-beam energy transfer.},

	abstract = {In direct-drive inertial confinement fusion, target offset from the target chamber center (or center of beam convergence) may lead to significant implosion asymmetry and fusion yield degradation. In addition, cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) has been shown to be a significant source of laser energy scattering and leads to a reduction in implosion velocity and yield. To improve energy coupling and implosion performance, several techniques for CBET mitigation have been proposed. Recent simulations, however, have shown that CBET also substantially mitigates the effect of target offset on implosion asymmetry and yield [Anderson et al., Phys. Plasmas 27, 112713 (2020)]. Furthermore, the inclusion of CBET models in radiation-hydrodynamics codes was shown to greatly improve agreement between simulations and experiments involving substantial target offset distances. This paper explores the intensity dependence of this CBET–offset effect. In addition, it is shown that enhanced sensitivity to target offset can be expected when CBET-mitigation techniques are used in direct-drive implosions. This is shown through simulations of two such CBET-mitigation techniques on the OMEGA laser: (1) decreased beam-to-target radius, and (2) beam-to-beam frequency detuning. For the typical target offset distances ({\textless}15 lm) observed in experiments on OMEGA, however, overall yield is still anticipated to be substantially higher when CBET-mitigation techniques are employed.},

Consequently, simulation codes that are used to design experiments are computationally expensive and lack the predictive capability required for extensive parameter exploration in search of a high-performing design for laser direct drive. In this article, we present two deeplearning-based predictive models intended to address these difficulties. The first model (TL DNN) acts as a fast emulator of simulations as well as experiments at the Omega Laser Facility. This model is trained on a simulation database and subsequently calibrated on experimental data using transfer learning. To facilitate the development of this model, an autoencoder is developed to reduce the dimensionality of the input space by compressing the laser pulse input. The model predicts key experimental scalar observables of Omega experiments with high accuracy and minimal computational cost. This deep neural net enables rapid exploration of a high-dimensional input parameter space for an optimal implosion design. The second model (DNN SMþ) aims to extend the statistical modeling work of Lees et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 105001 (2021)], by increasing the complexity of the model space and allowing for coupling between degradation terms. Since the model capacity of DNN SMþ is higher than the model of Lees et al., DNN SMþ can potentially provide an improvement in predictive capability, and we use this model to provide insight into complicated degradation dependencies.},

Good predictive capability has been demonstrated for the fusion yield using a statistical mapping of simulated outcomes to experimental data [Gopalaswamy et al., Nature 565(771), 581–586 (2019)]. In this paper, a physics-based statistical mapping approach is used to extract and quantify all the major sources of degradation of fusion yield for direct-drive implosions on the OMEGA laser. The yield is found to be dependent on the age of the deuterium tritium ﬁll, the ‘ ¼ 1 asymmetry in the implosion core, the laser beam-to-target size ratio, and parameters related to the hydrodynamic stability. A controlled set of experiments were carried out where only the target ﬁll age was varied while keeping all other parameters constant. The measurements were found to be in excellent agreement with the ﬁll age dependency inferred using the mapping model. In addition, a new implosion design was created, guided by the statistical mapping model by optimizing the trade-offs between increased laser energy coupling at larger target size and the degradations caused by the laser beam-to-target size ratio and hydrodynamic instabilities. When experimentally performed, an increased fusion yield was demonstrated in targets with larger diameters.},

	abstract = {The application of laser direct drive (LDD) research to ignition on the OMEGA laser depends on the degree to which implosions can be scaled in size (and energy) and use different beam geometries. In this talk we present an analysis of cryogenic experiments at two hydrodynamic scales (S = 0.8 and 1.0) [Ref.] and find that yield increases as S4 or faster after correcting for shot-to-shot sources of asymmetry (e.g., the laser pointing). These data also indicate a potential benefit in areal density (in excess of expectations) as targets become larger/thicker. This behavior could be due to changes in preheat or instability/mix (e.g., the capsule stalk) and will be discussed. We are also planning experiments that will quantify performance versus η =Rb /Rt, which is the ratio of the laser beam to target radius. The goal is to change the amplitude of the applied mode 10, which has been found to correlate with yield as η2 to η3 (Ref.). Lastly, we will connect this work to studies comparing spherical direct drive and polar direct drive, and consider implications to LDD research on OMEGA and the National Ignition Facility.

	abstract = {In inertial conﬁnement fusion implosion experiments, the presence of residual anisotropic ﬂuid motion within the stagnating hot spot leads to signiﬁcant variations in ion-temperature measurements using neutron time-of-ﬂight detectors along different lines of sight. The minimum ion-temperature measurement is typically used as representative of the thermal temperature. In the presence of isotropic ﬂows, however, even the minimum Deuterium–Tritium (DT) neutron-inferred ion temperature can be well above the plasma thermal temperature. Using both Deuterium–Deuterium (DD) and DT neutron-inferred ion-temperature measurements, we show that it is possible to determine the contribution of isotropic ﬂows and infer the DT burn-averaged thermal ion temperature. The contribution of large isotropic ﬂows on driving the ratio of DD to DT neutron-inferred ion temperatures well below unity and approaching the lower bound of 0.8 is demonstrated in multimode simulations. The minimum DD neutron-inferred ion temperature is determined from the velocity variance analysis, accounting for the presence of isotropic ﬂows. Being close to the DT burn-averaged thermal ion temperature, the inferred DD minimum ion temperatures demonstrate a strong correlation with the experimental yields in the OMEGA implosion database. An analytical expression is also derived to explain the effect of mode ‘ ¼ 1 ion-temperature measurement asymmetry on yield degradations caused by the anisotropic ﬂows.},

Here, we show that one-dimensional simulations can be used to predict the outcomes of systematically perturbed three-dimensional simulations and that this statistical modeling approach can be used to identify or rule out physical mechanisms for some of the degradation sources observed on the OMEGA Laser System for direct-drive cryogenic inertial conﬁnement fusion. In this instance, we investigate the fusion yield dependencies on the ion temperature asymmetries and laser beam size observed in experiments by comparing with trends in three-dimensional synthetic simulation databases. Using the statistical model on these systematically perturbed simulations, we ﬁnd that the statistically inferred dependency on the measured ion temperature asymmetries is well explained by imposed ‘ ¼ 1 modes. However, we ﬁnd that the dependency on the laser beam size is only dominated by the illumination nonuniformity for some extreme cases.},

	abstract = {Direct-drive-implosion experiments on the OMEGA laser [T. R. Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)] have showed discrepancies between simulations of the scattered (non-absorbed) light levels and measured ones that indicate the presence of a mechanism that reduces laser coupling efficiency by 10\%–20\%. This appears to be due to crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) that involves electromagnetic-seeded, low-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering. CBET scatters energy from the central portion of the incoming light beam to outgoing light, reducing the laser absorption and hydrodynamic efficiency of implosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including CBET show good agreement with all observables in implosion experiments on OMEGA. Three strategies to mitigate CBET and improve laser coupling are considered: the use of narrow beams, multicolor lasers, and higher-Z ablators. Experiments on OMEGA using narrow beams have demonstrated improvements in implosion performance.},

	abstract = {In direct drive inertial confinement laser fusion, a pellet containing D-T fuel is imploded by ablation arising from absorption of laser energy at its outer surface. For optimal coupling, the focal spot of the laser would continuously decrease to match the reduction in the pellet's diameter, thereby minimizing wasted energy. A krypton-fluoride laser (λ = 248 nm) that incorporates beam smoothing by induced spatial incoherence has the ability to produce a high quality focal profile whose diameter varies with time, a property known as focal zooming. A two-stage focal zoom has been demonstrated on the Nike laser at the Naval Research Laboratory. In the experiment, a 4.4 ns laser pulse was created in which the on-target focal spot diameter was 1.3 mm (full width at half maximum) for the first 2.4 ns and 0.28 mm for the final 2 ns. These two diameters appear in time-integrated focal plane equivalent images taken at several locations in the amplification chain. Eight of the zoomed output beams were overlapped on a 60 μm thick planar polystyrene target. Time resolved images of self-emission from the rear of the target show the separate shocks launched by the two corresponding laser focal diameters.},

Electron heat flow is known, since the work of Luciani, Mora, and Virmont (LMV) [Phys. Rev.

The present work aims at extending the original formula of LMV to two or three dimensions of space. This multidimensional extension leads to an equivalent transport equation suitable for easy implementation in a two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic code.

In laser produced plasmas, it is now believed that the heat transport can be strongly modified by the nonlocal nature of the electron conduction. Other mechanisms, such as self-generated magnetic fields, may also affect the heat transport. The model described in this work, based on simplified Fokker-Planck equations aims at extending the model of G. Schurtz, Ph. Nicolaï, and M. Busquet [Phys. Plasmas 7, 4238 (2000)] to magnetized plasmas. A complete system of nonlocal equations is derived from kinetic equations with self-consistent electric and magnetic fields. These equations are analyzed and simplified in order to be implemented into large laser fusion codes and coupled to other relevant physics. The model is applied to two laser configurations that demonstrate the main features of the model and point out the nonlocal Righi-Leduc effect in a multidimensional case.},

To study the model's effect on DRACO's predictive capability, simulations of shot 60 303 from OMEGA are completed using the iSNB model, and the computed shock speed vs. time is compared to experiment. Temperature outputs from the iSNB model are compared with the non-local transport model of Goncharov et al. [Phys. Plasmas 13, 012702 (2006)]. Effects on adiabat are also examined in a polar drive surrogate simulation. Results show that the iSNB model is not only capable of flux-limitation but also preheat prediction while remaining numerically robust and sacrificing little computational speed. Additionally, the results provide strong incentive to further modify key parameters within the SNB theory, namely, the newly introduced non-local mean free path.

Laser pulse shapes for both low and high-foot pulses were modified to vary ablation-front growth and fuel adiabat, separately and controllably. Three principal conclusions are drawn from this study: (1) It is shown that reducing ablation-front instability growth in low-foot implosions results in a substantial (3-10X) increase in neutron yield with no loss of fuel compression. (2) It is shown that reducing the fuel adiabat in high-foot implosions results in a significant (36\%) increase in fuel compression together with a small (10\%) increase in neutron yield. (3) Increased electron preheat at higher laser power in high-foot implosions, however, appears to offset the gain in compression achieved by adiabat-shaping at lower power. These results taken collectively bridge the space between the higher compression low-foot results and the higher yield high-foot results.},

Two different approaches to broadband ray-based CBET modeling (discrete and ﬁxed spectrum) are developed and compared to wave-based calculations. Both approaches give good agreement with wave-based calculations in ICF-relevant conﬁgurations.

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that broadband laser light has the potential to control parametric instabilities in inertial-conﬁnement-fusion (ICF) plasmas. Here, we use results from laser-plasma-interaction simulations to estimate the bandwidth requirements for mitigating the three predominant classes of instabilities in direct-drive ICF implosions: cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), two-plasmon decay (TPD), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). We ﬁnd that for frequency-tripled, Nd:glass laser light, a bandwidth of 8.5 THz can signiﬁcantly increase laser absorption by suppressing CBET, while \$13 THz is needed to mitigate absolute TPD and SRS on an ignition-scale platform. None of the glass lasers used in contemporary ICF experiments, however, possess a bandwidth greater than 1 THz and reaching larger values requires the use of an auxiliary broadening technique such as optical parametric ampliﬁcation or stimulated-rotational-Raman scattering. An arguably superior approach is the adoption of an argon-ﬂuoride (ArF) laser as an ICF driver. Besides having a broad bandwidth of \$10 THz, the ArF laser also possesses the shortest wavelength (193 nm) that can scale to the high energy/power required for ICF—a feature that helps to mitigate parametric instabilities even further. We show that these native properties of ArF laser light are sufﬁcient to eliminate nearly all CBET scattering in a direct-drive target and also raise absolute TPD and SRS thresholds well above those for broadband glass lasers. The effective control of parametric instabilities with broad bandwidth is potentially a “game changer” in ICF because it would enable higher laser intensities and ablation pressures in future target designs.},

	abstract = {Low-density foams of low-/mid-Z materials have been previously proposed to mitigate laser imprint for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF). For foam densities above the critical density of the drive laser, the mechanism of laser-imprint mitigation relies on the reduced growth rate of Rayleigh–Taylor instability because of the increased ablation velocity and density scale length at the ablation surface. Experimental demonstration of this concept has been limited so far to planar-target geometry. The impact of foams on spherical implosions has not yet been explored in experiments. To examine the viability of using an above-critical-density foam layer to mitigate laser-imprint effects in direct-drive ICF implosions on OMEGA, we have performed a series of 2-D DRACO simulations with state-of-the-art physics models, including nonlocal thermal transport, cross-beam energy transfer, and first-principles equation-of-state tables. The simulation results indicate that a 40-μm-thick CH or SiO2 foam layer with a density of ρ = 40 mg/cm3 added to a D2-filled polystyrene (CH) capsule can significantly improve the moderate-adiabat (α ≈ 3) implosion performance. In comparison to the standard CH target implosion, an increase in neutron yield by a factor of 4 to 8 and the recovery of 1-D compression ρR are predicted by DRACO simulations for a foam-target surface roughness of σrms ≤ 0.5 μm. These encouraging results could readily facilitate experimental demonstrations of laser-imprint mitigation with an above-critical-density foam layer.},

A comprehensive understanding of seeding mechanisms is essential to characterize the impact of target defects on inﬂight shell integrity and mass injection into the central, lower-density vapor region. An analysis of early-time behavior of both single-mode shell mass modulations and isolated voids is performed by examining the evolution of the acoustic waves launched by these target imperfections. A systematic study of localized perturbation growth as a function of defect placement and size is presented. The use of low-density ablator materials (such as foams) is suggested as a potential mitigation strategy to improve target robustness against the impact of defect-initiated growth.},

Three implosions were performed with similar convergence ratios, fuel entropy, in-ﬂight aspect ratios, and unablated shell mass; these qualities are important for determining hydrodynamic stability. Nevertheless, while two of these implosions exhibited robustness to asymmetries, including our recent experiment that had abnormally large amplitude long-wavelength capsule asymmetries, and produced more than 80\% or the yield predicted by one-dimensional (1D) simulations, which do not account for the impacts of hydrodynamic instabilities, the third implosion produced only 14\% of the yield from a 1D simulation. We perform a detailed computational analysis of these three shots, which suggests that the combination of several large asymmetry seeds result in the signiﬁcantly degraded performance: a large 30 lm ﬁll tube, the presence of a microstructure in the high density carbon ablator, and a higher level of drive asymmetry. This indicates that while it is possible to stabilize a high convergence ratio implosion through various means, the factors that determine stability cannot be considered independently. Furthermore, when these asymmetries are combined in 2D simulations, they can exhibit destructive interference and underpredict the yield degradation compared to experiment and three-dimensional simulations.},

	abstract = {The effect of asymmetries on the performance of inertial confinement fusion implosions is investigated. A theoretical model is derived for the compression of distorted hot spots, and quantitative estimates are obtained using hydrodynamic simulations. The asymmetries are divided into low (ℓ\&lt;6) and intermediate (6\&lt;ℓ\&lt;40) modes by comparison of the mode wavelength with the hot-spot radius and the thermal-diffusion scale length. Long-wavelength modes introduce substantial nonradial motion, whereas intermediate-wavelength modes involve more cooling by thermal losses. It is found that for distorted hot spots, the measured neutron-averaged properties can be very different from the real hydrodynamic conditions. This is because mass ablation driven by thermal conduction introduces flows in the Rayleigh–Taylor bubbles that results in pressure variations, in addition to temperature variations between the bubbles and the neutron-producing region. The differences are less pronounced for long-wavelength asymmetries since the bubbles are relatively hot and sustain fusion reactions. The yield degradation—with respect to the symmetric case—results primarily from a reduction in the hot-spot pressure for low modes and from a reduction in burn volume for intermediate modes. A general expression is found relating the pressure degradation to the residual shell energy and the flow within the hot spot (i.e., the total residual energy).},

Lett. 117, 025001 (2016)]. All the experimental observables pertaining to the core could be reconstructed simultaneously with the same combination of low and mid-modes. This suggests that in addition to low modes, which can cause a degradation of the stagnation pressure, mid-modes are present which reduce the size of the neutron and x-ray producing volume. The systematic analysis shows that asymmetries can cause an overestimation of the total areal density in these implosions. It is also found that an improvement in implosion symmetry resulting from correction of either the systematic mid or low modes would result in an increase in the hot-spot pressure from 56 Gbar to ≈ 80 Gbar and could produce a burning plasma when the implosion core is extrapolated to an equivalent 1.9 MJ symmetric direct illumination [Bose et al., Phys. Rev. E 94, 011201(R) (2016)].},

Ablator materials of moderate atomic number Z reduce the detrimental effects of laser–plasma instabilities in direct-drive implosions. To validate the physics of moderate-Z ablator materials for ignition target designs on the National Ignition Facility (NIF), hydro-equivalent targets are designed using pure plastic (CH), high-density carbon, and glass (SiO2) ablators. The hydrodynamic stability of these targets is investigated through two-dimensional (2D) single-mode and multimode simulations. The overall stability of these targets to laser-imprint perturbations and low-mode asymmetries makes it possible to design high-gain targets. Designs using polar-drive illumination are developed within the NIF laser system specifications. Mid-Z ablator targets are an attractive candidate for direct-drive ignition since they present better overall performance than plastic ablator targets through reduced laser–plasma instabilities and a similar hydrodynamic stability.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) during OMEGA low-adiabat cryogenic experiments reduces the hydrodynamic efficiency by ∼35\%, which lowers the calculated one-dimensional (1-D) yield by a factor of 7. CBET can be mitigated by reducing the diameter of the laser beams relative to the target diameter. Reducing the diameter of the laser beams by 30\%, after a sufficient conduction zone has been generated (two-state zooming), is predicted to maintain low-mode uniformity while recovering 90\% of the kinetic energy lost to CBET. A radially varying phase plate is proposed to implement two-state zooming on OMEGA. A beam propagating through the central half-diameter of the phase plate will produce a large spot, while a beam propagating through the outer annular region of the phase plate will produce a narrower spot. To generate the required two-state near-field laser-beam profile, a picket driver with smoothing by spectral dispersion (SSD) would pass through an apodizer, forming a beam of half the standard diameter. A second main-pulse driver would co-propagate without SSD through its own apodizer, forming a full-diameter annular beam. Hydrodynamic simulations, using the designed laser spots produced by the proposed zooming scheme on OMEGA, show that implementing zooming will increase the implosion velocity by 25\% resulting in a 4.5× increase in the 1-D neutron yield. Demonstrating zooming on OMEGA would validate a viable direct-drive CBET mitigation scheme and help establish a pathway to hydrodynamically equivalent direct-drive–ignition implosions by increasing the ablation pressure (1.6×), which will allow for more stable implosions at ignition-relevant velocities.},

An increased ablation pressure will allow a more-massive shell (i.e. thicker and more hydrodynamically stable) and a higher adiabat to achieve ignition-relevant velocities ({\textgreater}3.5 × 107 cm s−1), areal densities ({\textgreater}300 mg cm−2) and hot-spot pressures ({\textgreater}100 Gbar). Two approaches have demonstrated increased ablation pressure: (1) a target design is shown that uses a Be ablator to increase the hydrodynamic efficiency, resulting in a ∼10\% increase in the ablation pressure, in comparison to a CH ablator; (2) reducing the beam size is shown to recover all of the ablation pressure lost to cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), i.e. the ablation pressure calculated without CBET, but the degraded illumination uniformity reduces the integrated target performance. The hydrodynamic efficiency is measured for the current cryogenic design, multiple ablator material design and CH capsule designs with various beam focal-spot sizes. In each case, an excellent agreement is observed with 1D hydrodynamic simulations that include CBET and nonlocal heat-transport models.},

	abstract = {The use of magnetic fields to improve the performance of hohlraum-driven implosions on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is discussed. The focus is on magnetically insulated inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where the primary field effect is to reduce electron-thermal and alpha-particle loss from the compressed hotspot (magnetic pressure is of secondary importance). We summarize the requirements to achieve this state. The design of recent NIF magnetized hohlraum experiments is presented. These are close to earlier shots in the three-shock, high-adiabat (BigFoot) campaign, subject to the constraints that magnetized NIF targets must be fielded at room-temperature, and use {\textless} 1 MJ of laser energy to avoid risk of optics damage from stimulated Brillouin scattering. We present results from the original magnetized hohlraum platform, as well as a later variant which gives higher hotspot temperature. In both platforms, imposed fields (at the capsule center) of up to 28 T increase the fusion yield and hotspot temperature. Integrated radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic (rad-MHD) modeling with the Lasnex code of these shots is shown, where laser power multipliers and a saturation clamp on cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) are developed to match the time of peak capsule emission and the P2 Legendre moment of the hotspot x-ray image. The resulting fusion yield and ion temperature agree decently with the measured relative effects of the field, although the absolute simulated yields are higher than the data by 2.0-2.7X. The tuned parameters and yield discrepancy are comparable for experiments with and without an imposed field, indicating the model adequately captures the field effects. Self-generated and imposed fields are added sequentially to simulations of one BigFoot NIF shot to understand how they alter target dynamics.},

	abstract = {We examine the potential that imposed magnetic fields of tens of Tesla that increase to greater than 10 kT (100 MGauss) under implosion compression may relax the conditions required for ignition and propagating burn in indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets. This may allow the attainment of ignition, or at least significant fusion energy yields, in presently performing ICF targets on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) that today are sub-marginal for thermonuclear burn through adverse hydrodynamic conditions at stagnation [Doeppner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 055001 (2015)]. Results of detailed two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic-burn simulations applied to NIF capsule implosions with low-mode shape perturbations and residual kinetic energy loss indicate that such compressed fields may increase the probability for ignition through range reduction of fusion alpha particles, suppression of electron heat conduction, and potential stabilization of higher-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Optimum initial applied fields are found to be around 50 T. Given that the full plasma structure at capsule stagnation may be governed by three-dimensional resistive magneto-hydrodynamics, the formation of closed magnetic field lines might further augment ignition prospects. Experiments are now required to further assess the potential of applied magnetic fields to ICF ignition and burn on NIF.},

The model is simple enough to permit a survey of the parameter space available for magnetized fuel by computing the behaviour of thousands of targets. The survey predicts the existence of a totally new region in parameter space where significant thermonuclear fuel burn-up can occur. The new region is characterized by very low fuel densities, very low implosion velocities, and.most important, driver requirements reduced by several orders of magnitude, suggesting that 'break-even' experiments may be possible with existing inertial confinement fusion drivers.

In regimes where propagating burn does not occur, the burn can be enhanced by a magnetic field. In regimes where propagating deflagration would normally occur in the absence of a magnetic field, magnetic fields actually degrade the cross-field propagation. A detonation wave is harder to ignite in the presence of a magnetic field. Once a detonation wave is ignited, no change in the propagation speed is produced by applying a magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Significant departures from standard transport coefficients [e.g., Sov. Phys. JETP 6, 338 (1958)] have been found for the electron current and heat flux in a fully ionized plasma. These have been discovered by carrying out a direct and accurate numerical solution of the linearized Fokker–Planck equation using a Cartesian tensor expansion of the distribution function. The results, which were carried out for plasmas of various atomic numbers, show the presence of major inaccuracies (errors of up to 65\%) in Braginskii coefficients β■, κ⊥, and κ■ (as conventionally defined) for Hall parameters ωτ in the range 0.3≲ωτ≲30. Surprisingly, α■ and β⊥ are found to depend on τ/(ωτ)2/3 and 1/(ωτ)5/3, and not on τ/(ωτ) and 1/(ωτ)2, respectively, as ωτ→∞. An analytic expansion for large ωτ verifies this result, showing that the relatively cold unmagnetized electrons in the distribution function play a dominant role in the cross-field transport. The numerical results are fitted to within 15\% to a polynomial in ωτ for various values of Z.},

	abstract = {An important ingredient in numerical modelling of high temperature magnetized astrophysical plasmas is the anisotropic transport of heat along magnetic ﬁeld lines from higher to lower temperatures. Magnetohydrodynamics typically involves solving the hyperbolic set of conservation equations along with the induction equation. Incorporating anisotropic thermal conduction requires to also treat parabolic terms arising from the diffusion operator. An explicit treatment of parabolic terms will considerably reduce the simulation time step due to its dependence on the square of the grid resolution ( x) for stability. Although an implicit scheme relaxes the constraint on stability, it is difﬁcult to distribute efﬁciently on a parallel architecture. Treating parabolic terms with accelerated super-time-stepping (STS) methods has been discussed in literature, but these methods suffer from poor accuracy (ﬁrst order in time) and also have difﬁcult-to-choose tuneable stability parameters. In this work, we highlight a second-order (in time) Runge–Kutta–Legendre (RKL) scheme (ﬁrst described by Meyer, Balsara \& Aslam 2012) that is robust, fast and accurate in treating parabolic terms alongside the hyperbolic conversation laws. We demonstrate its superiority over the ﬁrst-order STS schemes with standard tests and astrophysical applications. We also show that explicit conduction is particularly robust in handling saturated thermal conduction. Parallel scaling of explicit conduction using RKL scheme is demonstrated up to more than 104 processors.},

To measure the thermally driven transport of magnetic ﬂux and electron energy, a simple experimental conﬁguration is explored computationally using a laser-heated pre-magnetized under-dense plasma. Changes to the laser heating proﬁle precipitate clear diagnostic signatures from the Nernst, cross-gradient-Nernst, anisotropic conduction, and Righi-Leduc heat-ﬂow.

	abstract = {High-intensity laser facilities, such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF), enable the experimental investigation of plasmas under extreme, high-energy-density conditions. Motivated by validating models for collisional heat-transfer processes in high-energy-density plasmas, we have developed an exploding pusher platform for use at the NIF in the polar-direct-drive configuration. The baseline design employs a 3 mm-diameter capsule, an 18 μm-thick CH ablator, and Ar-doped D2 gas to achieve several keV electron-ion temperature separations with relatively low convergence ratios. In an initial series of shots at the NIF—N160920–003, -005, and N160921–001—the ratio of the laser intensity at different polar angles was varied to optimize the symmetry of the implosion. Here we summarize experimental results from the shot series and present pre- and post-shot analysis. Although the polar-direct-drive configuration is inherently asymmetric, we successfully tuned a post-shot 1D model to a set of key implosion performance metrics. The post-shot model has proven effective for extrapolating capsule performance to higher incident laser drive. Overall, the simplicity of the platform and the efficacy of the post-shot 1D model make the polar-direct-drive exploding pusher platform attractive for a variety of applications beyond the originally targeted study of collisional processes in high-energy-density plasmas.},

Plastic capsules 3–4 mm in diameter were filled with 1.5 mg/cc of deuterium–tritium (DT) fuel and imploded with laser beam pointing and defocus designed to compensate for polar asymmetry introduced by the facility beam entrance angles. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulations were employed to optimize the multi-dimensional laser and target parameter space, within facility and target fabrication constraints. Ensembles of 1D simulations tuned to match the outputs of early shots in the series were used to design subsequent shots in the series. This allowed the later shots to be designed based on empirically motivated sensitivities to laser and target input parameters, while eliminating the need to explicitly model phenomena such as hydrodynamic instabilities and nonlinear laser–plasma interactions. One experiment with a 3.0 mm diameter CH capsule produced 13.6 kJ (4.81 × 1015 DT neutrons) from a laser input below the NIF optics damage threshold at 585 kJ, 328 TW.

With mega-Gauss magnetic fields, scattering of optical lasers already becomes manifestly anisotropic. Special angles exist where coherent laser scattering is either enhanced or suppressed, as we demonstrate using a cold-fluid model. Consequently, by aiming laser beams at special angles, one may be able to optimize laser-plasma coupling in magnetized implosion experiments. In addition, magnetized scattering can be exploited to improve the performance of plasma-based laser pulse amplifiers. Using the magnetic field as an extra control variable, it is possible to produce optical pulses of higher intensity, as well as compress UV and soft x-ray pulses beyond the reach of other methods. In even stronger giga-Gauss magnetic fields, laser-plasma interaction enters a relativistic-quantum regime. Using quantum electrodynamics, we compute a modified wave dispersion relation, which enables correct interpretation of Faraday rotation measurements of strong magnetic fields.},

This paper presents simulations of offset ICF implosions improved by including a physics model of cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a mechanism of laser energy scattering from one beam to another. Room-temperature OMEGA implosion experiments with prescribed target offsets are simulated with and without CBET, illustrating that CBET mitigates the ‘ ¼ 1 implosion asymmetry from the target offset. Comparison of simulations to multiple complementary experimental observables indicates that the addition of CBET physics in offset simulations is necessary to match experimental results.},

Before being imploded, the targets were immersed in an 80-kG magnetic seed field. Upon laser irradiation, the high implosion velocities and ionization of the target fill trapped the magnetic field inside the capsule, and it was amplified to tens of megagauss through flux compression. At such strong magnetic fields, the hot spot inside the spherical target was strongly magnetized, reducing the heat losses through electron confinement. The experimentally observed ion temperature was enhanced by 15\%, and the neutron yield was increased by 30\%, compared to nonmagnetized implosions [P. Y. Chang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 035006 (2011)]. This represents the first experimental verification of performance enhancement resulting from embedding a strong magnetic field into an ICF capsule.

Experiments, simulations and theory all agree that the performance enhancement due to magnetization for this platform has approximately plateaued by 26T. This talk investigates (using the extended-magnetohydrodynamics code Gorgon [3,4]) benefits of applying non-uniform magnetic fields. For example, a magnetic mirror field is found to enhance the maximum performance improvement; this is due to the hot-spot having a greater surface area where the heat-flow is suppressed. A cusp magnetic field, which can be achieved by reversing the coil turn axis on different ends of the hohlraum, is also investigated. The application of closed magnetic field lines is found to have the greatest impact on the hot-spot electron temperature, although it is still unclear how such a magnetic field topology would be applied experimentally. This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.},

	abstract = {Simulations anticipate increased perturbation growth from non-uniform laser heating for magnetized direct-drive implosions. At the capsule pole, where the magnetic field is normal to the ablator surface, the field remains in the conduction zone and suppresses non-radial thermal conduction; in unmagnetized implosions this non-radial heat-flow is crucial in mitigating laser heating imbalances. Single-mode simulations show the magnetic field particularly amplifying short wavelength perturbations, whose behavior is dominated by thermal conduction. The most unstable wavelength can also become shorter. 3D multi-mode simulations of the capsule pole reinforce these findings, with increased perturbation growth anticipated across a wide range of scales. The results indicate that high-gain spherical direct-drive implosions require greater constraints on the laser heating uniformity when magnetized.},

	abstract = {Pre-magnetisation of inertial conﬁnement fusion implosions on the National Ignition Facility has the potential to raise current high-performing targets into the ignition regime [Perkins et al. “The potential of imposed magnetic ﬁelds for enhancing ignition probability and fusion energy yield in indirect-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion,” Phys. Plasmas 24, 062708 (2017)]. A key concern with this method is that the application of a magnetic ﬁeld inherently increases asymmetry. This paper uses 3-D extended-magnetohydrodynamics Gorgon simulations to investigate how thermal conduction suppression, the Lorentz force, and a-particle magnetisation affect three hot-spot perturbation scenarios: a cold fuel spike, a time-dependent radiation drive asymmetry, and a multi-mode perturbation. For moderate magnetisations (B0 ¼ 5 T), the single spike penetrates deeper into the hot-spot, as thermal ablative stabilisation is reduced. However, at higher magnetisations (B0 ¼ 50 T), magnetic tension acts to stabilise the spike. While magnetisation of a-particle orbits increases the peak hot-spot temperature, no impact on the perturbation penetration depth is observed. The P4-dominated radiation drive asymmetry demonstrates the anisotropic nature of the thermal ablative stabilisation modiﬁcations, with perturbations perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld penetrating deeper and perturbations parallel to the ﬁeld being preferentially stabilised by increased heat-ﬂows. Moderate magnetisations also increase the prevalence of high modes, while magnetic tension reduces vorticity at the hot-spot edge for larger magnetisations. For a simulated high-foot experiment, the yield doubles through the application of a 50 T magnetic ﬁeld-an ampliﬁcation which is expected to be larger for higher-performing conﬁgurations.},

	abstract = {The ﬁeld of nuclear diagnostics for Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion (ICF) is broadly reviewed from its beginning in the seventies to present day. During this time, the sophistication of the ICF facilities and the suite of nuclear diagnostics have substantially evolved, generally a consequence of the efforts and experience gained on previous facilities. As the fusion yields have increased several orders of magnitude during these years, the quality of the nuclear-fusion-product measurements has improved signiﬁcantly, facilitating an increased level of understanding about the physics governing the nuclear phase of an ICF implosion. The ﬁeld of ICF has now entered an era where the fusion yields are high enough for nuclear measurements to provide spatial, temporal and spectral information, which have proven indispensable to understanding the performance of an ICF implosion. At the same time, the requirements on the nuclear diagnostics have also become more stringent. To put these measurements into context, this review starts by providing some historical remarks about the ﬁeld of ICF and the role of nuclear diagnostics, followed by a brief overview of the basic physics that characterize the nuclear phase and performance of an ICF implosion. A technical discussion is subsequently presented of the neutron, gamma-ray, charged-particle and radiochemistry diagnostics that are, or have been, routinely used in the ﬁeld of ICF. This discussion is followed by an elaboration of the current view of the next-generation nuclear diagnostics. Since the seventies, the overall progress made in the areas of nuclear diagnostics and scientiﬁc understanding of an ICF implosion has been enormous, and with the implementation of new high-fusion-yield facilities world-wide, the nextgeneration nuclear diagnostics will play an even more important role for decades to come.},
