	abstract = {Ray-based cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) models have become a common feature of the radiation-hydrodynamic codes used to simulate inertial conﬁnement fusion experiments. These models are necessary for achieving better agreement with experimental measurements, but their detailed implementation can vary widely between the codes and often rely on artiﬁcial multipliers. To address this, a series of 2D and 3D test cases has been developed with validated solutions from wave-based calculations. Comparisons of various ray-based CBET models to the wave-based calculations highlight the essential physics that is required for accurate ray-based CBET modeling. Quantitative comparison metrics and/or ﬁeld data from the wave-based calculations have been made available for use in the validation of other ray-based CBET codes.},

	abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion experiments are sensitive to cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that redistributes laser energy in the coronal plasma through self-generated ion acoustic wave (IAW) gratings. The detailed CBET coupling depends on the polarization state of the crossing wavefields. CBET itself can also scramble the beam polarizations by inducing ellipticity through the IAW grating, and rotating the seed polarization toward that of the pump. We develop a ray-based model that describes the polarized CBET coupling and that is compatible with the framework of 3D inline radiative hydrodynamics simulations. The model is implemented in the ASTER/IFRIIT code and verified against an academic test case and an offline polarized CBET post-processor. It is then applied to the detailed configuration of the distributed polarization rotator system on OMEGA, where results highlight how polarized CBET induces significant low modes in the collisional absorption source term. Finally, the modeling is applied to a simple indirect-drive configuration, comparing CBET calculations with 96 unpolarized or polarized beams with 24 unpolarized quads. It is shown that these cases produce similar power amplification per cone of beams grouped with similar polar angles. However, the 96 beam geometry itself is found to reduce azimuthal variations in quad power after the interaction and favors beams with larger polar angles within the cones, an effect that is amplified by the polarized CBET. Application of the model to inline calculations of OMEGA implosions are presented in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {We present the first 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of directly driven inertial confinement fusion implosions with an inline package for polarized crossed-beam energy transfer, which were used to assess the impact of the current distributed polarization rotators (DPRs) on OMEGA as well as other known sources of asymmetry. Applied to OMEGA implosions, the simulations predict bang times with no need for ad hoc multipliers, as well as yields—if you separately account for the impacts of imprint and fuel age. The magnitude of the flow is well reproduced when the low mode sources are large, whereas the modeling of the stalk is thought to be required to match the flow magnitude in the remaining cases. For the cases explored in more detail, polarized cross-beam energy transfer (CBET)—the only known systematic drive asymmetry, brought the results closest to the measured flow vectors. The remaining discrepancies are shown to be stemming from the limited knowledge of the laser pointing modes. For typical current levels of beam mispointing, power imbalance, target offset, and asymmetry caused by polarized CBET, low modes degrade the yield by more than 40\%. The current strategy of attempting to compensate the mode-1 asymmetry with a preimposed target offset recovers only about one-third of the losses caused by the low modes due to the dynamic nature of the multiple asymmetries and the presence of low modes other than l = 1. Therefore, addressing the root causes of the drive asymmetries is apt to be more beneficial. To that end, one possible solution to the specific issue of polarized CBET (10 µm DPRs) is shown to work well.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to efficiently model 3-D laser plasma interactions at fluid scales is presented. This method, implemented in the IFRIIT propagation code developed at CELIA, relies on inverse ray tracing to compute laser fields at arbitrary locations in a plasma. This enables to describe the fields at high order in space compared to standard forward ray tracing approaches. In addition, inverse ray tracing enables the use of etalon integral methods to reconstruct caustic fields and greatly speeds up calculations of cross-beam energy transfer by decoupling the ray amplitude and ray phase calculations. A comparison of the inverse and forward methods for 3-D calculations of fields in presence or not of cross-beam energy transfer illustrates the significant advantages of the inverse method. Conversely, while the inverse method is well suited to most spherical plasma profiles, it currently cannot treat concave profiles or target holders. The coupling of IFRIIT with the 3-D ASTER radiative hydrodynamics code developed at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics is then presented. ASTER and IFRIIT resolve their respective equations on separate grids which communicate through interpolation. As such, IFRIIT uses a dedicated laser grid adapted to the computations at play, which also allows to use different parallelization methods for both codes: block decomposition for the hydrodynamics versus domain duplication for the laser. Applications to direct-drive implosions for inertial confinement fusion are presented, for which a geodesic icosahedron grid is implemented in IFRIIT. The performances of the ASTER/IFRIIT coupling are demonstrated by conducting simulations of cryogenic implosions performed on the OMEGA laser system, in presence of various sources of 3-D effects; laser port geometry, cross-beam energy transfer, beam imbalance and target mis-alignment. Comparison with neutron data, measured through bang-time, for a cryogenic implosion experiment shows an excellent agreement for the laser-plasma coupling.},

	abstract = {The prediction that laser plasma heating distorts the electron distribution function away from Maxwellian and towards a super-Gaussian distribution dates back four decades1. In conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, however, no direct evidence of this so-called ‘Langdon effect’ has previously been observed. Here we present measurements of the spatially and temporally resolved Thomson scattering spectrum that indicate the presence of super-Gaussian electron distribution functions consistent with existing theory2. In such plasmas, ion acoustic wave frequencies increase monotonically with the super-Gaussian exponent3. Our results show that the measured power transfer between crossed laser beams mediated by ion acoustic waves requires a model that accounts for the non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, whereas the standard Maxwellian calculations overpredict power transfer over a wide region of parameter space. Including this effect is expected to improve the predictive capability of crossed-beam energy transfer modelling at the National Ignition Facility in California and may restore a larger operable design space for inertial confinement fusion experiments. This is also expected to motivate further inquiry in other areas affected by non-Maxwellian electron distribution functions, such as laser absorption, heat transport and X-ray spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {The compression of direct-drive inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) targets is strongly impacted by cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a laser-plasma instability that limits ablation pressure by redirecting laser energy outward and that is projected to be mitigated by laser bandwidth. Here, we explore various CBET mitigation constraints to guide the design of future ICF facilities. First, we ﬁnd that the ﬂat, Gaussian, and Lorentzian spectral shapes have similar CBET mitigation properties, and a ﬂat shape with nine spectral lines is a good surrogate for what can be obtained with other spectral shapes. Then, we conduct a comprehensive study across energy scales and ignition designs. 3D hydrodynamic simulations are used to derive an analytical model for the expected CBET mitigation as a function of laser and plasma parameters. From this model, we study the bandwidth requirements of conventional and shock ignition designs across four different energy scales and ﬁnd that they require between 0.5 and 3 6 0:2\% relative bandwidth. Best mitigation is achieved when the beam radius over critical radius Rb=Rc is kept low during the drive while the plasma temperature is kept high. In a steady state, we ﬁnd that the bandwidth required to mitigate 85\% of CBET scales as ðRb=RcÞ2:15LÀn 0:58I0:7, where Ln is the density scale length, and I the laser intensity. Finally, we ﬁnd that the chamber beam port layout does not inﬂuence CBET mitigation. In the case of a driver using many monochromatic beamlets, we ﬁnd that \$10 beamlets per port is required, with diminishing returns above \$20.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) results from two-beam energy exchange via seeded stimulated Brillouin scattering, which detrimentally reduces laser-energy absorption for direct-drive inertial confinement fusion. Consequently, ablation pressure and implosion velocity suffer from the decreased absorption, reducing target performance in both symmetric and polar direct drive. Additionally, CBET alters the time-resolved scattered-light spectra and redistributes absorbed and scattered-light–changing shell morphology and low-mode drive symmetry. Mitigating CBET is demonstrated in inertial confinement implosions at the National Ignition Facility by detuning the laser-source wavelengths (±2.3 Å UV) of the interacting beams. In polar direct drive, wavelength detuning was shown to increase the equatorial region velocity experimentally by 16\% and to alter the in-flight shell morphology. These experimental observations are consistent with design predictions of radiation–hydrodynamic simulations that indicate a 10\% increase in the average ablation pressure. These results indicate that wavelength detuning successfully mitigates CBET. Simulations predict that optimized phase plates and wavelength-detuning CBET mitigation utilizing the three-legged beam layout of the OMEGA Laser System significantly increase absorption and achieve \&gt;100-Gbar hot-spot pressures in symmetric direct drive.},

Each reﬁnement can be seen as a ﬁner grid in a multiple-grid system. The standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates using a multiple-grid system is detailed and an inadequacy in the method is presented. A new algorithm of particle to node weighting in a multiple-grid system is then described and compared to the standard bilinear weighting method in two-dimensional (r–z) cylindrical coordinates. This description pays particular attention to the nodes near the interface between grids of diﬀering cell-size. The volume weighting method used in this study is geometrically similar to the standard bilinear PIC method in Cartesian coordinates, but weights in proportion to the volumes of revolution of the areas about the z-axis, rather than the areas themselves. As the volume weighting method has the axisymmetric geometry built in, it is a natural system to use in this particular case. A full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of metal plasma-immersion ion implantation and deposition (MePIIID) of a ﬂat stage using three grids of cell size: 0.5 · 0.5, 1 · 1 and 2 · 2 mm; is performed and results are compared to those obtained from a single-grid simulation with the same parameters.

	abstract = {Understanding magnetised laser–plasma interactions is important for controlling magneto-inertial fusion experiments and developing magnetically assisted radiation and particle sources. For nanosecond pulses at non-relativistic intensities, interactions are dominated by coherent three-wave interactions, whose nonlinear coupling coefﬁcients became known only recently when waves propagate at oblique angles with the magnetic ﬁeld. In this paper, backscattering coupling coefﬁcients predicted by warm-ﬂuid theory are benchmarked using particle-in-cell simulations in one spatial dimension, and excellent agreements are found for a wide range of plasma temperatures, magnetic ﬁeld strengths and laser propagation angles, when the interactions are mediated by electron-dominant hybrid waves. Systematic comparisons between theory and simulations are made possible by a rigorous protocol. On the theory side, the initial boundary value problem of linearised three-wave equations is solved, and the transient-time solutions allow the effects of growth and damping to be distinguished. On the simulation side, parameters are carefully chosen and calibration runs are performed to ensure that comparisons are well controlled. Fitting simulation data to analytical solutions yields numerical growth rates that match theory predictions within error bars. Although warm-ﬂuid theory is found to be valid for a wide parameter range, genuine kinetic effects have also been observed.},

	abstract = {Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) is thought to be responsible for a 30\% reduction in hydrodynamic coupling efficiency on OMEGA and up to 50\% at the ignition scale for direct-drive (DD) implosions. These numbers are determined by ray-based models that have been developed and integrated within the radiation–hydrodynamics codes LILAC (1-D) and DRACO (2-D). However, ray-based modeling of CBET in an inhomogeneous plasma assumes a steady-state plasma response, does not include the effects of beam speckle, and treats ray caustics in an ad hoc manner. The validity of the modeling for ignition-scale implosions has not yet been determined. To address the physics shortcomings, which have important implications for DD inertial confinement fusion, a new wave-based model has been developed. It solves the time-enveloped Maxwell equations in three dimensions, including polarization effects, plasma inhomogeneity, and open-boundary conditions with the ability to prescribe beams incident at arbitrary angles. Beams can be made realistic with respect to laser speckle, polarization smoothing, and laser bandwidth. This, coupled to a linearized low-frequency plasma response that does not assume a steady state, represents the most-complete model of CBET to date.},

Theory and simulation of mitigation through increased laser bandwidth,” Phys. Plasmas 29, 042707 (2022)], where we examine the efficacy of increases in laser bandwidth at suppressing CBET. We choose laser and plasma conditions for the simulations that are favorable to CBET and promote nonlinearity. Through a comparison of outputs from the particle-in-cell code vector particle in cell (VPIC) and the linearized fluid code laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE), a series of nonlinear effects have been identified in the kinetic simulations that include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion-acoustic wave self-focusing. These effects produce time-dependent energy transfer, in contrast to the linearized fluid simulations in which a steady state is reached after an initial transient. Ion trapping is shown to allow for increased energy transfer relative to fluid simulations, with the remaining nonlinear processes acting to reduce the energy transfer. Nonlinear dynamics is contrasted for low- and high-intensity beams as well as between speckled and planar beams. For the parameters under consideration, beam profile has a significant effect on nonlinear dynamics, though the greatest sensitivity is to beam intensity.},

	abstract = {The response of the cross-beam energy transfer instability (CBET) to laser bandwidth is investigated through a combination of theory and simulation. Existing linear theory is generalized to treat broadband lasers, demonstrating that CBET is most effectively suppressed when the bandwidth exceeds the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) frequency. It is shown that for such bandwidths, reverse (seed to pump) transfer becomes possible, which reduces the net energy transfer rapidly as bandwidth is increased. The CBET gain exponent in this regime scales with bandwidth (Δω) as Δω−3 for Gaussian or Lorentzian laser spectra with different scalings possible for other spectra. Comparison of our theory with linearized fluid and particle-in-cell simulations, performed with the laser-plasma simulation environment (LPSE) and vector particle in cell (VPIC) codes, respectively, finds that the model is accurate in the absence of nonlinear processes. However, linear analysis also finds that the IAW energy density scales as Δω−1, implying that nonlinear effects may be more difficult to control than the CBET scaling would suggest. Indeed, nonlinear effects are found to be present in VPIC simulations with high-intensity lasers, despite minimal apparent CBET. Nonlinear processes in the VPIC cases include particle trapping, the two-ion wave decay, and ion wave self-focusing. In some high intensity VPIC cases, these effects lead to net energy transfer from seed to pump and increases to backscatter stimulated Brillouin scattering reflectivities. Finally, for a given bandwidth, we show that improved control of nonlinear processes can be achieved via smoothing by spectral dispersion.},

            Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The energy density of these fields is typically comparable to the energy density of the fluid motions of the plasma in which they are embedded, making magnetic fields essential players in the dynamics of the luminous matter. The standard theoretical model for the origin of these strong magnetic fields is through the amplification of tiny seed fields via turbulent dynamo to the level consistent with current observations. However, experimental demonstration of the turbulent dynamo mechanism has remained elusive, since it requires plasma conditions that are extremely hard to re-create in terrestrial laboratories. Here we demonstrate, using laser-produced colliding plasma flows, that turbulence is indeed capable of rapidly amplifying seed fields to near equipartition with the turbulent fluid motions. These results support the notion that turbulent dynamo is a viable mechanism responsible for the observed present-day magnetization.},

	abstract = {Astrophysical collisionless shocks are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. Generated by violent interactions of supersonic plasma flows with the interstellar medium, supernova remnant shocks are observed to amplify magnetic fields1 and accelerate electrons and protons to highly relativistic speeds2–4. In the well-established model of diffusive shock acceleration5, relativistic particles are accelerated by repeated shock crossings. However, this requires a separate mechanism that pre-accelerates particles to enable shock crossing. This is known as the ‘injection problem’, which is particularly relevant for electrons, and remains one of the most important puzzles in shock acceleration6. In most astrophysical shocks, the details of the shock structure cannot be directly resolved, making it challenging to identify the injection mechanism. Here we report results from laser-driven plasma flow experiments, and related simulations, that probe the formation of turbulent collisionless shocks in conditions relevant to young supernova remnants. We show that electrons can be effectively accelerated in a first-order Fermi process by small-scale turbulence produced within the shock transition to relativistic non-thermal energies, helping overcome the injection problem. Our observations provide new insight into electron injection at shocks and open the way for controlled laboratory studies of the physics underlying cosmic accelerators. In laser–plasma experiments complemented by simulations, electron acceleration is observed in turbulent collisionless shocks. This work clarifies the pre-acceleration to relativistic energies required for the onset of diffusive shock acceleration.},

	abstract = {In conventional gases and plasmas, it is known that heat fluxes are proportional to temperature gradients, with collisions between particles mediating energy flow from hotter to colder regions and the coefficient of thermal conduction given by Spitzer’s theory. However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly collisional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in galaxy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a system in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a reduction of heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading to large temperature variations on small spatial scales (as is seen in cluster plasmas).
