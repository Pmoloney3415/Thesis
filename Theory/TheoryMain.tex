\chapter{The Interaction of Light with Plasma}%
\label{chap:Theory}

This chapter shall introduce theoretical background relevant to the work conducted in this thesis.
The main focus of the work is centred on improving the laser modelling in the \textsc{Chimera} \ac{Rad-MHD} code.
Therefore, the theoretical framework for modelling both the plasma and the interaction of light with it is introduced.

Initially, the plasma state is defined and important length- and time-scales are provided in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_plasma_phys}.
The kinetic and fluid descriptions of plasma are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_kin_fluid_plasmas} and the validity domain of each framework is discussed, with particular reference to typical conditions for laser-plasma interactions.
Additional physics packages of the fluid code, \textsc{Chimera}, which are utilised in later chapters, are introduced.
A model for kinetic heatflow is desirable in fluid codes which model laser-plasma interactions, therefore although \textsc{Chimera} does not have this capability, some basic theory of kinetic heatflow is highlighted.

An additional aim of the work was to include a \ac{CBET} model into the new \textsc{Chimera} laser package.
\ac{LPIs} such as \ac{CBET} are multi-wave coupling phenomena, and therefore a basic description of waves in plasma is provided in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_waves_plasmas}.
The dispersion relation of the light waves in plasma is also derived.
Beginning with the full wave equation and then introducing successive assumptions which are broadly satisfied in typical laser-produced \ac{ICF} plasmas, Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_propagation} derives the equations of ray-tracing.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_absorption} important absorption processes are then outlined, particularly \ac{Inv-Brem}, which is the dominant mechanism on the largest \ac{ICF} facilities in the world today.
Finally, the basic theory of \ac{LPIs} is provided in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_LPIs}, particularly \ac{CBET} and its relevance for direct-drive \ac{ICF}.

\section{Basic Plasma Physics}%
\label{sec:theory_plasma_phys}

As stated in Chap.~\ref{chap:intro}, thermonuclear fusion requires the fuel to exist at significant temperatures, which are well above ionisation energies.
Therefore, the fuel configuration in these fusion experiments is a plasma.
Formally, a plasma is defined as a quasi-neutral, ionised gas which exhibits collective behaviour~\cite{chen_introduction_2018}.
The charged particles within a plasma interact via the long-range Coulomb force, and thus undergo many simultaneous interactions with the other particles.
This leads to a variety of collective phenomena such as the plasma-waves described in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_waves_plasmas}.
Quasineutrality of the plasma means that, when observed at a length-scale $L$, the plasma has no net charge,
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{\alpha}q_{\alpha}N_{\alpha} = 0,
\end{equation}
where $N_{\alpha}$ is the number of particles of species $\alpha$, with charge $q_{\alpha}$, in the cube with volume $V=L^3$.
For a `single-species' plasma\footnote{Single-species here means that there is only a single type of ion.} with average ionisation state $Z$, this implies,
\begin{equation}
    n_e = Z n_i,
\end{equation}
where $n_e$ and $n_i$ are the number densities of electrons and ions respectively.

Quasineutrality arises because the particles in the plasma are free to move due to forces they experience.
Thus, if a local charge imbalance occurs, the electrons, which respond faster than the ion population due to their lower mass, move to rebalance this field and restore quasineutrality.
This electron relocation to eliminate local electric fields is known as Debye-screening.
The length scale below the electron population cannot effectively screen the charges sets the length scale of quasineutrality, and is known as the Debye-length,
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{D}^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2},
\end{equation}
where $T_e$ is the electron temperature, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $e$ is the electron charge.
This screening can only occur if there is a large number of particles in the Debye sphere, $n_e L^3\gg 1$.

The timescale of the charge relocation is of particular importance to the interaction of light with plasmas.
Light waves are an oscillating electric field, which the charged particles in the plasma can respond to.
If the particles are able to respond quickly enough, they can therefore influence the propagation of the light and ultimately force the plasma can become opaque to the propagating light wave.
The oscillation timescale can be derived by considering a uniform assembly of quasineutral plasma and then displacing the electron population from the ions by a small distance $\delta x$ along the $x$-axis.
The electric field which develops within the plasma is thus,
\begin{equation}
    E_x = \frac{n_e e \delta x}{\varepsilon_0},
\end{equation}
leading to a restoring force $F_x = -eE_x$ on each electron.
Solving Newton's second Law demonstrates that, when thermal motion of the electron population is ignored\footnote{Inclusion of thermal motion leads to pressure, which acts as a restoring force, and yields the dispersion relation for an \ac{EPW}.}, oscillations of the electrons occur at the `plasma frequency',
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_plasma_freq}
    \omega_{p}^2 = \frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \varepsilon_0}.
\end{equation}
If forcing oscillations occur at a frequency which is lower than $\omega_p$, then the electrons move rapidly enough to nullify the field.
Consider light with frequency $\omega$, which is incident normal to a plasma density gradient
Because $\omega_p\propto n_e$, the light is able to propagate until it reaches the density where $\omega = \omega_p$, which is known as the critical density,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_critical_density}
    n_{\text{cr}} = \frac{m_e \varepsilon_0 \omega^2}{e^2}.
\end{equation}
After reaching the critical density, the field of the light decays exponentially as an evanescent wave, but cannot propagate.

\section{The Kinetic and Fluid Formulations}%
\label{sec:theory_kin_fluid_plasmas}

Idealised computational modelling of a plasma state would solve the long-range electro-magnetic interaction between every pair of particles at all times.
However, this very rapidly becomes intractable due to the large number $N$ of particles and the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ scaling of interactions to solve.
Reduced frameworks must thus be devised with which to analyse and predict the behaviour of the plasma state.
Plasmas are divided into two broad classifications.
When in local thermal equilibrium, the plasma is often described as `thermal' and the fluid formulation is an adequate description.
There are numerous situations when this is not true however, for instance if a particular subset of particles is heated at a rate, which is much faster than thermalising collision timescales.
In this case, the subset of the system is described as `non-thermal' or `kinetic'.
The fluid formulation becomes an inadequate description and higher fidelity, kinetic tools must be used to describe the evolution of the system.

When a kinetic description of a plasma is required, the distribution function, $f_{\alpha}(\vec{x},\vec{v},t)$ is used to describe the state of particle species $\alpha$.
It provides a statistical description of the number density of particles, which inhabit a phase-space, $\vec{x}$-$\vec{v}$, at time $t$.
If the system evolves on a timescale much lower than the collision time and plasma length scales are lower than the collisional mean free-path, then these collisions between particles act to locally relax the distribution function toward a Maxwellian,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_maxwellian}
    f_{\alpha,\text{Max.}}(v) = n_{\alpha} {\left( \frac{1}{2\pi v_{T\alpha}^2} \right)}^{1.5} e^{-\left [ v/ \left (\sqrt{2} v_{T\alpha} \right ) \right ]^2},
\end{equation}
where $v_{T\alpha}=\sqrt{k_B T_{\alpha}/m_{\alpha}}$ is the thermal speed of the species with temperature and mass $T_{\alpha}$ and $m_{\alpha}$, respectively.
The fraction outside the exponential is set such the integral over velocity space yields the number density of the species.
Typically, for bulk of the target configuration throughout a laser-produced \ac{ICF} implosion, the assumption of a Maxwellian distribution is close to accurate, although there are several notable exceptions.
For instance, DT fusion products have energies much higher than thermal energies and are also monoenergetic.
\ac{LPIs} also generate energetic electron populations which are able to range through the implosion due to their low collisionality~\cite{barlow_role_2022}.
Additionally, laser-heated plasmas typically exhibit steep density and temperature gradients near the ablation surface, such that collisions, and therefore collision processes such as transport of thermal energy, do not act locally~\cite{epperlein_practical_1991}.
When performing fluid simulations of \ac{ICF} experiments, accurate modelling of these phenomena requires specific non-local modelling techniques.

\subsection{The Vlasov Equation}%
\label{sec:theory_vlasov}

The evolution of the distribution function for each species individually, is described by the Vlasov equation,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_vlasov}
    \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} + \vec{v}.\nabla_x f_\alpha + \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B}) . \nabla_v f_\alpha = \left ( \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} \right )_\text{collisions} + \left ( \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} \right )_\text{external},
\end{equation}
where $q_\alpha$ is the charge of the species, $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are the macroscopic electric and magnetic fields\footnote{Macroscopic here means on a scale larger than the Debye length.}, respectively, and $\nabla_x$ and $\nabla_v$ are gradients with respect to position and velocity coordinates respectively~\cite{bittencourt_fundamentals_2004}.
The equation describes the conservation of phase-space particle density.
The collision operator on the right-hand side of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_vlasov} describes the action of microscopic fields, which arise due to the random motion of the charged plasma particles.
External forces, for example gravity, are also accounted for in the second right-hand side term.
Evolution of the macroscopic fields is governed by Maxwell's equations,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_1}
    \nabla.\vec{E} &= \frac{\rho_{\text{charge}}}{\varepsilon_0},\\
    \label{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_2}
    \nabla.\vec{B} &= 0,\\
    \label{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_3}
    \nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t},\\
    \label{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_4}
    \nabla \times \vec{B} &= \mu_0 \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \vec{J},
\end{align}
where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\rho_{\text{charge}}$ is the charge density, $\vec{J}$ is the current density and $\nabla\equiv \nabla_x$.
In the general case with three spatial dimensions, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_vlasov} is seven dimensional and evolves on small spatial and temporal scales.
Therefore, it is typically too expensive to solve in its entirety for the relatively long times and large spatial scales of an entire \ac{ICF} implosion.
Solution methods to the Vlasov equation include \ac{VFP} codes, which discretise the 6-D phase space of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_vlasov} and evolve the state forward in time~\cite{thomas_review_2012}.
The velocity space can be either directly discretised~\cite{taitano_eulerian_2021}, or expanded in spherical harmonics~\cite{kingham_implicit_2004}.
Alternatively, the distribution function can be approximated by Monte Carlo techniques, which is done in \ac{PiC} codes~\cite{arber_contemporary_2015}

\subsection{The Fluid Equations}%
\label{sec:theory_fluid}

Due to the expense of the Vlasov equation, the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium can be used to derive the fluid equations.
By inserting Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_maxwellian} into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_vlasov}, multiplying each side of the equation by functions of $\vec{v}$ and integrating over velocity space, the fluid equations can be derived.
This process is known as taking moments of the Vlasov equation.
A moment of the Vlasov equation at order $n$ of $\vec{v}$ yields an equation which depends upon the $n+1$ moment.
A solvable system of equations thus requires an external closure.
The inviscid hydrodynamic equations\footnote{Note that since the velocity dependence has been integrated out, all variables are now only functions of $\vec{x}$.} are obtained from $n=[0,1,2]$ moments,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:theory_fluid_eqs_1}
    \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u_\alpha}.\nabla \right ] \rho_\alpha + \rho_\alpha\nabla . \vec{u_\alpha} &= 0,\\
    \label{eq:theory_fluid_eqs_2}
    \rho_\alpha \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u_\alpha}.\nabla \right ] \vec{u_\alpha} &= -\nabla P_\alpha + \vec{F}_{\alpha,L} + \vec{F}_{\alpha,\text{ext.}} + \vec{F}_{\alpha,\text{col.}},\\
    \label{eq:theory_fluid_eqs_3}
    \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u_\alpha}.\nabla \right ] U_\alpha + (U_\alpha + P_\alpha)\nabla.\vec{u_\alpha} &= -\nabla . \vec{q_\alpha} + Q_{\alpha,\text{ext.}} + Q_{\alpha,\text{col.}},
\end{align}
where $\rho_\alpha$ is the mass density of species $\alpha$, $\vec{u_\alpha}$ is the fluid velocity, $U_\alpha$ is the internal energy, $P_\alpha$ is the isotropic pressure, $\vec{F}_{\alpha,L} = n_\alpha q_\alpha (\vec{E} + \vec{u}_\alpha \times \vec{B})$ is the Lorentz, $\vec{F}_{\alpha,\text{ext.}}$ is external forcing, $\vec{F}_{\alpha,\text{col.}}$ is collisional forcing, $\vec{q_\alpha}$ is the heat flux, $Q_{\alpha,\text{ext.}}$ is external heating or cooling and $Q_{\alpha,\text{col.}}$ is collisional heating or cooling~\cite{castor_radiation_2004}.
A closure relation for the plasma pressure can be obtained from an \ac{EoS}, such as the ideal gas law, which relates pressure to density, temperature and energy density.
The heat flux can be obtained from Fourier's law,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_fourier_heat}
    \vec{q_\alpha} = -\kappa \nabla T_\alpha,
\end{equation}
where the thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, is obtained from local transport theory~\cite{braginskii_transport_1965,epperlein_plasma_1986}.

The single-fluid, two temperature hydrodynamic equations can be obtained by assuming quasineutrality ($Z n_i = n_e = n$), the electron mass is negligible to the ion mass ($m_i \gg m_e$) and modelling only a single ion-species\footnote{When multiple ion-species compose the plasma, \textit{e.g.} for CH ablator or DT fuel, then the average ion mass (by number density) must be used and frictional forces/ temperature separation between ion species ignored.}.
The populations will therefore be co-moving, and it follows that,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \rho &\equiv m_i n_i + m_e n_e &&\approx m_i n,\\
    \vec{u} &\equiv \frac{(\rho_i \vec{u}_i + \rho_e \vec{u}_e)}{\rho} &&\approx \vec{u}_i,
\end{alignat}
where the fluid density, $\rho$, and velocity, $\vec{u}$, have been defined.
Noting also that collisions within a fluid will not affect their net momentum and that collisional forces between the electron and ion will cancel, the fluid equations for electrons and ions can be added to obtain the single-fluid, two temperature equations,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_1}
    \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u}.\nabla \right ] \rho + \rho\nabla . \vec{u} &= 0,\\
    \label{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_2}
    \rho \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u}.\nabla \right ] \vec{u} &= -\nabla P + \vec{F}_{L},\\
    \label{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_3}
    \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u}.\nabla \right ] U_e + (U_e + P_e)\nabla.\vec{u} &= -\nabla . \vec{q_e} + Q_{e,\text{ext.}} + Q_{e,\text{col.}},\\
    \label{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_4}
    \left [ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{u}.\nabla \right ] U_i + (U_i + P_i)\nabla.\vec{u} &= -\nabla . \vec{q_i} + Q_{i,\text{ext.}} + Q_{i,\text{col.}},
\end{align}
where the total pressure is defined, $P=P_e+P_i$, the external forcing has been dropped, and equilibration between the electron and ion temperatures occurs via the collisional heating terms $Q_{\alpha,\text{col.}}$.
By defining the current from electron motion in the frame of the plasma, $\vec{J}=-n_e e (\vec{u}_e - \vec{u})$ and utilising quasineutrality, the Lorentz force term in the single fluid approximation,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_lorentz_force}
    \vec{F}_{L} = \vec{J}\times\vec{B}.
\end{equation}
The \textsc{Chimera} code solves the two-temperature, single fluid equations.
In the absence of magnetic fields, the Lorentz force term goes to zero.
Macroscopic magnetic fields can be included under the extended-\ac{MHD} framework, and their evolution and effect on plasma transport and dynamics is discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_MHD}.
Further details of the numerical solution to the fluid equations can be found in Refs.~\cite{chittenden_signatures_2016,walsh_extended_2018,crilly_simulation_2020,farrow_extended_2023,oneill_modelling_2023,chaturvedi_simulating_2024}. 
Additional physics packages are included by calculating contributions to the external forces and heating.
For example, the non-thermal fusion products are modelled by a Monte Carlo treatment, which collide with the bulk plasma and thus deposit energy which contributes to the electron and ion $Q_{\alpha,\text{ext.}}$~\cite{tong_burn_2019}.
The additional physics packages which are utilised in the subsequent work presented in this manuscript are discussed briefly below.

\subsection{Radiation Transport}%
\label{sec:theory_radtransp}

For this section, a distinction between coherent, approximately visible or \ac{UV} wavelength laser radiation, and higher frequency ($\omega \gg \omega_p$) x-ray radiation is drawn.
The former is the main focus of Chap.~\ref{sec:SOLAS}.
It refracts significantly in coronal plasma density gradients and radiation at this wavelength is not significantly re-emitted by the thermal plasma.
In contrast, the latter does not significantly refract and is re-emitted by in \ac{ICF} plasma conditions.
The latter is accounted for numerically in \textsc{Chimera} by a radiation transport algorithm, which is cursively described here.

In addition to driving the implosion of indirect-drive \ac{ICF} experiments, x-ray radiation is also significant in a wide array of laser-driven \ac{HEDP} physics experiments.
For example, the hot coronal plasma in direct-drive radiates a significant amount of energy as thermal Bremsstrahlung emission.
This both lowers the coronal temperatures, reducing the thermal conduction drive efficiency and also preheats the fuel, making it harder to compress.
Radiation acts both as a source and sink of energy, as it is radiated and emitted by the material, depending on the plasma conditions and the atomic properties.
Thermal emission is wavelength dependent and atomic transitions create sharp resonances of emissivity and opacity in wavelength space.
Therefore, the radiation-transport algorithm must be discretised in wavelength, depending on the properties of the material and the plasma conditions.

The radiative transfer equation describes the propagation, absorption, emission and scattering of photons with matter,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_rad_transfer}
    \frac{\partial I_\nu}{\partial t} + c \hat{\vec{\Omega}}.\nabla i_\nu = \left ( \frac{\partial I_\nu}{\partial t} \right )_{\text{collisions}} + \left ( \frac{\partial I_\nu}{\partial t} \right )_{\text{source}},
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $I_\nu$ is the spectrally resolved radiation intensity, $\hat{\vec{\Omega}}$ is the photon direction of travel~\cite{castor_radiation_2004}.
The left-hand side describes the advection of radiation at speed $c$ and the first and second terms on the right-hand side describe collisions between matter and photons, and emission or absorption of photons by the matter respectively.
Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_rad_transfer} is seven dimensional, and therefore is typically highly expensive to solve, so approximations are often employed to make solutions more tractable.
In analogy to derivation of the fluid equations from the Vlasov equation, angular moments of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_rad_transfer} can be taken to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
This also leads to a requirement for a closure relation, and the approach taken in \textsc{Chimera} is to use the $P_{1/3}$ closure, which works well for highly isotropic radiation fields~\cite{morel_diffusionlimit_2000}.
More detail of the \textsc{Chimera} implementation is provided in Refs.~\cite{jennings_radiation_2005,mcglinchey_radiationhydrodynamics_2017}.

\subsection{Magnetohydrodynamics}%
\label{sec:theory_MHD}

The method used to evolve macroscopic magnetic fields and their impact upon the plasma dynamics and transport is discussed in this section.
Magnetic fields are able to alter the evolution of the plasma state via the Lorentz force in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_2} and by altering the conductivities in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_fourier_heat}.
The relative importance of magnetisation can typically be broadly assessed by calculating dimensionless numbers.
For instance, the plasma $\beta$ describes the ratio of thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure\footnote{Using Amp\`ere's law with $(\partial \vec{E} / \partial t) \ll c^2$, the Lorentz force in Eq,~\ref{eq:theory_lorentz_force} can be recast as the sum of magnetic pressure and tension~\cite{oneill_modelling_2023}.},
\begin{equation}
    \beta = \frac{2 \mu_0 P}{|\vec{B}|^2}.
\end{equation}
This gives an order of magnitude estimate for when it is necessary to include the Lorentz force in the momentum equation, \textit{i.e.} for high beta plasmas, thermal pressure dominates over magnetic pressure.
Similarly, the Hall parameter, $\omega_\alpha \tau_\alpha$, describes the ratio of the gyrofrequency to the collision frequency for a species, $\alpha$.
For example, the electron Hall parameter,
\begin{equation}
    \omega_e \tau_e = \frac{e |\vec{B}|}{m_e} \frac{3\sqrt{m_e} (k_B T_e)^{1.5}}{4 \sqrt{2\pi} e^4 Z^2 n_i \ln \Lambda },
\end{equation}
where $\ln\Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, which is an important parameter for collisional phenomena that is related to the impact parameter of collisions~\cite{ramazanov_coulomb_2001,kodanova_investigation_2015,lin_temperature_2023}.
When $\omega_\alpha \tau_\alpha \sim 1$, then collisional phenomena, such as thermal conduction, are significantly affected by the magnetic field.

The evolution of the magnetic field is governed by Faraday's law (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_3}) and the electric field by Amp\`ere's law (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_4}).
This is not a closed system of equations due to the appearance of $\vec{J}$ in Amp\`ere's law however, and therefore an additional equation is required to evolve the fields.
This can be derived from the momentum equations for ions and electrons, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_fluid_eqs_2}~\cite{farrow_extended_2023}.
In the limit of no electron inertia, the left-hand side of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_fluid_eqs_2} is zero, leading to the `generalised Ohm's law',
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_GOL}
    \vec{E} = -\vec{u}\times\vec{B} + \frac{\vec{J}\times\vec{B}}{n_e e} - \frac{\nabla P_e}{n_e e} + \frac{1}{n_e e}\left( \frac{ \overline{\alpha} . \vec{J} }{ n_e e } - n_e \overline{\beta} . \nabla T_e \right),
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\alpha}$ and $\overline{\beta}$ are transport coefficient tensors, the precise form of which is described in, for example, Ref.~\cite{oneill_modelling_2023}.
Taking the curl of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_GOL} and combining with Faraday's law yields the magnetic induction equation,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_B_induction}
    \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \left( \vec{u}\times\vec{B} - \frac{\vec{J}\times\vec{B}}{n_e e} + \frac{\nabla P_e}{n_e e} - \frac{ \overline{\alpha} . \vec{J} }{ n_e^2 e^2 } + \frac{\overline{\beta} . \nabla T_e}{e} \right).
\end{equation}
Each term on the right-hand side of the Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_B_induction} is ascribed a physical affect.
The first term describes advection of the field with the movement of the plasma.
When this term dominates, the `ideal \ac{MHD}' framework is obtained, in which the field is said to be frozen-in to the flow.
Ideal \ac{MHD} can often be applied in fields such as space physics~\cite{parks_why_2004,mathioudakis_alfven_2013} and \ac{MCF}~\cite{boozer_equations_1998}, where many phenomena featuring highly conductive plasmas are well described by this limit.
In order from the second term on the right-hand side, the subsequent terms are related to, the Hall effect (collisionless advection of field with current), the Biermann effect (generation of field), resistive phenomena and thermoelectric phenomena.
The non-ideal terms of relevance to the work conducted in this thesis are discussed below.

%##########################################################
\subsubsection{Resistive MHD}%
\label{sec:theory_resisMHD}

When only the first term and the resistive term from Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_B_induction} are significant (and using a simple form for the transport coefficient, $\overline{\alpha}$), then the induction equation can be written,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \left( \vec{u}\times\vec{B} \right) - \nabla \times \left( \frac{\eta}{\mu_0}\nabla\times \vec{B} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the resistivity of the plasma~\cite{farrow_extended_2023}.
As already discussed, the first term describes advection of the plasma with the fluid, whereas the second term describes resistive diffusion of the plasma.
This effect moves $\vec{B}$ from regions of high- to low-field, via the damping of currents due to collisions between electrons and ions.
Resistive diffusion can lead to phenomena such as magnetic reconnection~\cite{kuznetsova_multiscale_2007,perez-colljimenez_role_2022}.
The relative importance of these two terms is described by the magnetic Reynolds number, which is the ratio field advection to diffusion,
\begin{equation}
    R_m = \frac{\mu_0 |\vec{u}| L}{\eta},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the characteristic length scale of the system.

%##########################################################
\subsubsection{The Nernst Effect}%
\label{sec:theory_nernst}

The Nernst effect arises from the thermoelectric term in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_B_induction}, and makes a contribution to the field induction,
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \right)_{\text{Nernst}} = \nabla \times \left( - \frac{\beta_{\wedge}}{e |\vec{B}|}\nabla T_e \times \vec{B} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{\wedge}$ is a transport coefficient.
This contribution looks like an advection of the field in the direction of $-\nabla T_e$ with a velocity,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{v}_{N} = -\frac{\beta_{\wedge}}{e |\vec{B}|}\nabla T_e.
\end{equation}
Nernst-advection of magnetic field is often of particular importance to magnetised \ac{HEDP} experiments, acting to move field down temperature gradients, even when the plasma is highly conductive~\cite{slutz_pulsedpowerdriven_2010,walsh_extended_2018}.
As this is a collisional phenomenon, it is most important in regions where the electron Hall parameter is low, $\omega_e\tau_e\ll 1$.

%##########################################################
\subsubsection{Magnetised Thermal Conduction}%
\label{sec:theory_magheatflow}

Magnetic fields can affect collisional transport anisotropically by forcing particles to gyrate around field lines, which changes their collisional behaviour anisotropically.
Because the Lorentz force does not affect particle motion in the direction parallel to field lines, transport along the direction, $\hat{\vec{b}}=\vec{B}/|\vec{B}|$, is unaffected by magnetisation.
However, the gyration around field lines restricts transport in the perpendicular direction, compared to the parallel direction.
Local transport analysis of the heat flux demonstrates that the electron thermal conduction heatflow can be expanded,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{q}_e = - \kappa_{\parallel} \hat{\vec{b}} \left( \hat{\vec{b}}.\nabla T_e \right) - \kappa_{\perp} \hat{\vec{b}} \times \left( \nabla T_e \times \hat{\vec{b}} \right) - \kappa_{\wedge} \hat{\vec{b}} \times \nabla T_e,
\end{equation}
where the $\kappa_{\parallel}$ term describes thermal conduction parallel to the field, $\kappa_{\perp}$ perpendicular to the field and $\kappa_{\wedge}$ perpendicular to the field and the temperature gradient~\cite{epperlein_plasma_1986}.
The wedge term, $\kappa_{\wedge}$, describes `Righi-Leduc' heatflow, which occurs along isotherms.
Considering the first two terms, when unmagnetised, $\kappa_{\parallel}=\kappa_{\perp}$ and conduction is isotropic.
As the magnetisation increases, however, $\kappa_{\perp}$ decreases with respect to $\kappa_{\parallel}$, for example, $\kappa_{\perp}/\kappa_{\parallel} \sim 1$ at $\omega_e\tau_e = 1$, which anisotropises the thermal conduction.

\subsection{Kinetic Heatflow}%
\label{sec:theory_kineticheatflow}

While the \textsc{Chimera} implementation of thermal transport is simply to use the local limit described in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_fourier_heat}, this is not always a valid approximation in laser produced plasmas.
When laser-heating is applied to a plasma, laser energy is transferred to the electron population mostly by \ac{Inv-Brem}, as is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_absorption}, heating the electron fluid to significant temperatures.
For laser-solid interactions, this often results in sharp temperature and density gradients in the conduction zone, where the thermal energy of the hot corona is transported via thermal conduction to an ablation surface.
To assess whether local transport theory is valid, the Knudsen number is a convenient parameter which compares the mean free path of electrons, $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ to the length scale of the gradient, $L$.
Specifically, the Knudsen number is defined,
\begin{equation}
    \text{Kn} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{mfp}}}{L} = \frac{3 (k_B^2 T_e^2)}{4 \sqrt{2\pi} e^4 Z^2 n_i \ln{\Lambda} L},
\end{equation}
and transport effects, become significantly non-local when $\text{Kn}\sim0.1$, which is often observed for high-power laser solid conduction zones~\cite{yuan_spacetime_2024}.
Physically, more energetic particles within a plasma are less collisional and also play a more significant role in heat flux because it is obtained a higher order moment quantity than density or fluid velocity.
Therefore, the fast heat carrying particles in the tail of the distribution function are able to range through longer length scales and preheat the fuel more than a local treatment would predict.
Although not included within \textsc{Chimera}, models for non-local transport exist, which can be included in fluid models, such as \textsc{Snb}~\cite{schurtz_nonlocal_2000,nicolai_practical_2006,cao_improved_2015,sherlock_comparison_2017}, Fast-\textsc{VFP}~\cite{bell_fast_2024} and \textsc{Rkm}~\cite{mitchell_reduced_2024}.
They obtain an improved heat flux estimate, $\vec{q}$, which accounts for non-local conduction effects such including pre-heat, ad can be included in the fluid framework.
Implementation of one of these models into \textsc{Chimera} could significantly improve the modelling capability for simulations involving laser-solid interactions, including direct-drive calculations.

\section{Waves in Fluid Plasma}%
\label{sec:theory_waves_plasmas}

\ac{LPIs} are a class of multi-wave coupling phenomena that occur when a light wave excites additional plasma-waves.
Therefore, understanding \ac{LPIs} requires some background theoretical knowledge of the relevant waves.
In the absence of a macroscopic magnetic field, three classes of wave can propagate in a plasma: the \ac{IAW}, the \ac{EPW} and the \ac{EMW}, \textit{i.e.} a light wave.
This section shall describe the basic theory of these waves and provide dispersion relations for their propagation.
The treatment provided in this section assumes that the plasma acts as a fluid.
For a full kinetic treatment, the reader is referred to the work of Michel in Ref.~\ref{michel_introduction_2023}, from which many of the following relations are also obtained.

\subsection{Plasmas as a Dielectric Medium}%
\label{sec:theory_dielectric}

Freely moving particles in a plasma are able to respond to external electric fields by relocating, which reduces the size of the field that the plasma sees.
In others words plasma are dielectric, and it is therefore convenient to define the permittivity of the plasma in analogy to solutions of Maxwell's equations in matter.
The dielectric displacement vector is defined,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{D} = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon \vec{E},
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the plasma\footnote{Outside of plasma physics, the displacement vector is usually defined $\vec{D} = \varepsilon\vec{E} = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_{r}$ and $\varepsilon_r$ is the `relative' permittivity.}.
Defining the electrical conductivity, $\sigma$, such that $\vec{J}=\sigma\vec{E}$ it can be shown that the permittivity takes the form,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_perm_def}
    \varepsilon = 1 + i\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0\omega} \equiv 1 + \chi,
\end{equation}
where the dielectric susceptibility, $\chi$, has been introduced~\cite{michel_introduction_2023}.
The permittivity and susceptibility represent the plasma response to applied fields.
In general, each species within a plasma contributes separately to the susceptibility, such that $\chi = \sum\nolimits_\alpha \chi_\alpha$, where $\chi_\alpha$ are the contributions from electrons and the individual ion species within the plasma.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Theory/Images/plasma_waves.png}
    \centering
    \caption{Particle motion in a) transverse and b) longitudinal plasma waves.
    This diagram was adapted from Ref.~\cite{michel_introduction_2023}.}%
    \label{fig:theory_plasma_waves}
\end{figure}

In order to describe waves, the plasma of the plasma must be described in observable variables.
Here, the plasma is treated as a fluid, and is allowed to respond linearly to the applied fields.
An initially uniform, stationary plasma in equilibrium is considered with a number density for each species, $n_{\alpha 0}$.
Assuming an ideal gas equation of state and plasma conditions, the plasma response is described by a velocity ($\delta \vec{v}_\alpha$) and density ($\delta n_\alpha$) perturbation, because the temperature perturbation is proportional to the density perturbation~\cite{michel_introduction_2023}.
Linearising, we seek a solution to the following plasma response,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    n_\alpha(\vec{x},t) &= n_{\alpha 0} + \delta n_\alpha(\vec{x},t),&&\\
    \vec{v}_\alpha(\vec{x},t) &= \vec{v}_{\alpha 0} + \delta \vec{v}_\alpha(\vec{x},t) &&= 0 + \delta \vec{v}_\alpha(\vec{x},t),\\
    \vec{E}(\vec{x},t) &= \vec{E}_{0} + \delta \vec{E}(\vec{x},t) &&= 0 + \delta \vec{E}(\vec{x},t),\\
    \vec{B}(\vec{x},t) &= \vec{B}_{0} + \delta \vec{B}(\vec{x},t) &&= 0 + \delta \vec{B}(\vec{x},t),\\
\end{alignat}
where the subscript 0 quantities are (constant) the equilibrium values and $\delta\vec{E}=\vec{E}$ and $\delta\vec{B}=\vec{B}$ are the applied fields.
Inserting the linearised equations for each species into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_1} and Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_singlefluid_eqs_2} it can be shown~\cite{michel_introduction_2023},
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:theory_wave1s_1}
    \frac{\delta n_\alpha}{n_{\alpha 0}} &= \frac{\vec{k}.\delta\vec{v}_\alpha}{\omega},\\
    \label{eq:theory_wave1s_2}
    \omega \delta\vec{v}_\alpha &= \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 \frac{\delta n_\alpha}{n_{\alpha 0}} \vec{k} + i\frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha}\vec{E},
\end{align}
where $\gamma_\alpha$ is the adiabatic index, $\omega$ is the conjugate variable of time, $t$, from a Laplace transform and $\vec{k}$ is the conjugate variable of space, $\vec{x}$, from a Fourier transform.
These equations can then be combined to relate $\delta n_\alpha$ and $\delta \vec{v}_\alpha$ to $\vec{E}$,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:theory_wave2s_1}
    \left[ \omega^2 - \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 k^2 \right]\frac{\delta n_\alpha}{n_{\alpha 0}} &= i \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \vec{k}.\vec{E},\\
    \label{eq:theory_wave2s_2}
    \left[ \omega^2 - \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 \vec{k}(\vec{k}.) \right]\delta \vec{v}_\alpha &= i \frac{q_\alpha \omega}{m_\alpha} \vec{k}.\vec{E}.
\end{align}
Assuming a plane wave of the form $\vec{E}\propto \exp{\left[ i\left( \vec{k}.\vec{x} - \omega t \right) \right]}$, we identify $\vec{k}$ as the wavenumber and $\omega$ as the angular frequency.
Using the Ansatz that waves can either be transverse ($\vec{k}.\vec{E}=0$) or longitudinal ($\vec{k}\times\vec{E}=0$), dispersion relations in the fluid regime can be obtained for admissible solutions using these equations.
Fig.~\ref{fig:theory_plasma_waves}.a and Fig.~\ref{fig:theory_plasma_waves}.b plot the motion of particles from each of these varieties.

\subsection{Electromagnetic Waves}%
\label{sec:theory_transwaves}

Firstly, the transverse wave solution shall be obtained, which is an \ac{EMW} propagating in the plasma.
Inserting the transverse wave Ansatz ($\vec{k}.\vec{E}=0$) into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_wave2s_2} demonstrates that $\vec{k}.\delta\vec{v}_\alpha=0$, and therefore $\delta\vec{v}_\alpha = \delta\vec{v}_{\alpha\perp}$.
The transformed equation for the conservation of momentum, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_wave1s_2} yields,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_EMW_quiver}
    \delta\vec{v}_{\alpha\perp} - i \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha \omega}\vec{E},
\end{equation}
which demonstrates that under the Lorentz force of the field, the particles undergo oscillatory `quiver' motion.
The quiver velocity of the ions is ignored because $m_i \gg m_e$ and therefore the ions are considered as a static background compared to the electron oscillations.
Therefore, the linearised current is only from the electron motion, $\sum\nolimits_\alpha\delta\vec{J}_\alpha\sim\delta\vec{J}_e = -e n_{e0}\delta \vec{v}_e = \sigma \vec{E}$.
Utilising the definition of the permittivity from Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_perm_def}, the plasma response to an \ac{EMW} is obtained,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \label{eq:theory_emw_epsilon}
    \varepsilon &= 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} &&= 1- \frac{n_{e0}}{n_{\text{cr}}},\\
    \chi &= - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}, &&
\end{alignat}
where the plasma frequency, defined previously in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_plasma_freq}, has emerged.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Theory/Images/EMW_disp_rel.png}
    \centering
    \caption{The dispersion relation for an \ac{EMW} propagating in a plasma.
    For $\omega<\omega_p$, the oscillatory plane wave Ansatz turns into a decaying evanescent wave, thus the wave does propagate.}%
    \label{fig:EMW_disp_rel}
\end{figure}

A dispersion relation can also be obtained by utilising Maxwell's equations.
Taking the curl of Faraday's law (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_3}) and combining this with Amp\`ere's law (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_maxwell_eqs_4}) to eliminate $\vec{B}$ yields,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:theory_manipulatedmaxwell}
    \left[ \partial_t^2 - c^2\nabla^2 + c^2 \nabla(\nabla.) \right]\vec{E} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_0}\partial_t \vec{J}.
\end{equation}
Inserting a plane wave Ansatz for $\vec{E}$ and inserting Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_emw_epsilon} to eliminate $\vec{J}$, the dispersion relation for an \ac{EMW} is obtained,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:emw_disp_rel}
    \omega^2 = \omega_p^2 + c^2 k^2,
\end{equation}
which is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:EMW_disp_rel}.
For $\omega<\omega_p$, Eq.~\ref{eq:emw_disp_rel} demonstrates that $k$ becomes imaginary and therefore the plane wave Ansatz turns into a non-propagating, exponentially decaying evanescent wave.
The phase $v_\phi$ and group $v_g$ velocities of the light are,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    v_\phi &= \frac{w}{k} &&= \frac{c}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}},\\
    v_g &= \frac{\partial w}{\partial k} &&= \sqrt{\varepsilon} c,
\end{alignat}
which defines the refractive index of plasma, $n_{\text{ref}}=\sqrt{\varepsilon} = \sqrt{1-n_e/n_{\text{cr}}}$.
Note that $\sqrt{\varepsilon}<1$ so $v_\phi>c$.
However, the group velocity, which is the speed that information travels, remains subluminal.

\subsection{Plasma Waves}%
\label{sec:theory_longwaves}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Theory/Images/IAW_EPW.png}
    \centering
    \caption{Illustration of electron (small blue circle) and ion (large red circle) motion in a) an \ac{IAW} and b) an \ac{EPW}.}%
    \label{fig:theory_IAW_EPW}
\end{figure}

Two propagating longitudinal wave can exist in an unmagnetised plasma, an \ac{EPW}, which are oscillations of the electron fluid on a timescale which is too fast for the ions to respond and an \ac{IAW}, which is a slower, joint oscillation of the electron and ion fluid.
The inertia of the \ac{EPW} and \ac{IAW} are set by the electron and ion masses respectively.
Electron pressure drives the \ac{EPW}, whereas both fluids contribute to the \ac{IAW} pressure, depending on the ionisation level of the plasma.
Fig.~\ref{fig:theory_IAW_EPW} illustrates particle motion in each wave.
Dispersion relations can be obtained similarly to the \ac{EMW} method from Sec.~\ref{sec:theory_transwaves}.
By first inserting the longitudinal Ansatz ($\vec{k}\times\vec{E}=0$) into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_wave2s_2} to obtain the particle motion in a longitudinal wave,
\begin{equation}
    \delta \vec{v}_\alpha = i \frac{q_\alpha \omega}{m_\alpha} \frac{\vec{E}}{\omega^2 - \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 k^2}.
\end{equation}
Unlike the \ac{EMW}, we make no assumptions yet about which species contribute to the current, and thus the general form of the conductivity for longitudinal waves includes contributions from all species,
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = i\omega\varepsilon_0 \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\omega_{p\alpha}^2}{\omega^2 - \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 k^2},
\end{equation}
which yields the longitudinal wave permittivity and equivalently susceptibility,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:long_permittivity}
    \varepsilon &= 1 + \sum_\alpha \chi_\alpha,\\
    \label{eq:long_susceptibility}
    \chi_\alpha  &= - \frac{\omega_{p\alpha}^2}{\omega^2 - \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 k^2}.
\end{align}
Inserting the plane wave Ansatz into~\ref{eq:theory_manipulatedmaxwell} and using Eq.~\ref{eq:long_permittivity} to eliminate $\vec{J}$ yields the generalised dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in a plasma,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:long_disp_rel}
    \varepsilon \vec{E} = 0.
\end{equation}
Further use of an Ansatz can be utilised to obtain a specific description of a particular plasma wave.
Note that unlike transverse waves, where $\delta n_\alpha=0$, which is seen by inserting $\vec{k}.\vec{E}$ into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory_wave2s_1}, longitudinal waves do give rise to a density perturbation, which heuristically can be understood by looking at Fig.~\ref{fig:theory_plasma_waves}.
This leads to an electric field within the plasma, which is important for damping.

The longitudinal susceptibility (Eq.~\ref{eq:long_susceptibility}) has a pole at $\omega^2 = \gamma_\alpha v_{T\alpha}^2 k^2$, suggesting unbounded growth of the wave when its phase velocity is close to the thermal velocity of the species, $\alpha$.
This does not occur in actuality however, due to a process known as Landau damping, which is a resonant exchange of energy from the wave to particles.
When the phase velocity of the wave approaches this resonance, particles with velocity just below the group velocity, $\vec{v}\lesssim\vec{v}_\phi$, are trapped in the potential created by the charge separation and accelerated.
This transfers energy from the wave to the particles and thus prevents unbounded growth of the density perturbation.

%##########################################################
\subsubsection{Electron Plasma Waves}%
\label{sec:theory_EPWs}

Firstly the \ac{EPW} shall be considered.
These are fast oscillations of the electron fluid such that the heavier ions do not respond on the oscillation timescale.
To arrive at the dispersion relation, the assumption that the phase velocity is much faster than the electron thermal velocity is made, such that the wave can freely propagate without experiencing strong Landau damping, $w/k \gg v_{Te}$.
This assumption also yields $\lambda \gg v_{Te}/\omega$, which states that electrons travelling at the thermal velocity will not move a significant portion of the wavelength, $\lambda$, in one oscillation.
Temperature equilibration is thus limited throughout the wave, which means that there is no heat flux and such the electron fluid is adiabatic.
An adiabatic fluid has $\gamma_e=3$, which is equivalent to a single degree of freedom in the motion.
Finally, assuming that the ions are slow due to their large mass, and thus do not contribute to the permittivity\footnote{Explicitly for the \ac{EPW}, $\omega/k \gg v_{Te} \gg v_{Ti}$ and thus $|\chi_e| \gg |\chi_i|$}.
By using these assumptions in the generalised dispersion relation for longitudinal plasma waves, Eq.~\ref{eq:long_disp_rel}, the dispersion relation for the \ac{EPW} is obtained,
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = \omega_{pe}^2 + 3k^2v_{Te}^2.
\end{equation}
Just as for light waves, \ac{EPW} cannot propagate at $\omega\geq\omega_{pe}$.
The phase and group velocity of the wave are obtained from this dispersion relation,
\begin{alignat}{2}
    v_\phi &= \frac{w}{k} &&= v_{Te}\frac{\sqrt{1+3k^2\lambda_{D}^2}}{k\lambda_D},\\
    v_g &= \frac{\partial w}{\partial k} &&= 3v_{Te}\frac{k\lambda_D}{\sqrt{1+3k^2\lambda_{D}^2}}.
\end{alignat}

%##########################################################
\subsubsection{Ion Acoustic Waves}%
\label{sec:theory_IAWs}

The \ac{IAW} is of particular importance to the work conducted in this thesis, because it is the wave that mediates the energy exchange between light waves in \ac{CBET}.
To obtain the dispersion relation for this wave, the phase velocity of the wave is assumed to be much greater than the thermal velocity of the ions, but much less than the electron thermal velocity\footnote{For the \ac{IAW}, $v_{Ti}\ll \omega/k \ll v_{Te}$.}.
Using the same logic as the electrons, the ion fluid is assumed to be adiabatic, so $\gamma_i=3$.
The electrons, however, move much faster than the wave.
Therefore, they are able to equilibrate their temperature across the wave in a single oscillation, and are taken to be isothermal ($\gamma_e=1$).
When inserted into Eq.~\ref{eq:long_disp_rel}, these assumptions yield the dispersion relation,
\begin{equation}
    \omega^2 = \frac{k^2}{1 + k^2\lambda_D^2}\frac{ZT_e}{m_i} + 3 k^2 v_{Ti}^2.
\end{equation}
For oscillation wavelengths much larger than the Debye length, $k \lambda_D \ll 1$, this simplifies to,
\begin{equation}
    \omega \approx c_s k,
\end{equation}
where the sound speed is defined,
\begin{equation}
    c_s = \sqrt{\frac{Z k_B T_e + 3 k_B T_i}{m_i}}.
\end{equation}
The phase and group velocity of the light are thus simply $c_s$ in this limit, so the wave is non-dispersive.

Commonly in \ac{ICF}, plasmas are composed of multiple ion species, for instance the ablator of \textsc{Omega} targets is commonly composed of a CH plastic or SiO$_2$ glass shell.
The \ac{IAW} properties are typically greatly altered due to the additional susceptibility contributions from each species.
This leads to multiple \ac{IAW} modes with distinct speeds and damping.
Denoting the `heavy' and `light' ion species as $h$ and $l$ respectively, a fast ion mode exists when the phase velocity is greater than both ion thermal velocities,
\begin{equation}
    v_{Th} \leq v_{Tl} \ll v_{\phi,\text{fast}} \ll v_{Te}.
\end{equation}
A fast mode is also observed when only the heavy ion species are slower than the phase velocity,
\begin{equation}
    v_{Th} \ll v_{\phi,\text{slow}} \ll v_{Tl}  \ll v_{Te}.
\end{equation}
This is of particular relevance to the work in this manuscript, since \ac{CBET} in direct-drive typically occurs in multi-ion ablators, and it is moderated by an energy exchange via an \ac{IAW}.
Therefore, for example, different wave phenomena can affect the growth and saturation of energy transfer and must be accurately accounted for in computational modelling.
This leads to the different \ac{CBET} treatments, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:SOLAS_ray_power_change}.
