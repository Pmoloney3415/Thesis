The magnitude of the electron velocity just before ($\mathbf {w}$) and just after ($\mathbf {w}'$) the collision is the same, since the collision is elastic. However, the electron continues its quiver motion ($\mathbf {u}$) just after the collision and thus the time-averaged velocities before ($\mathbf {v}$) and after ($\mathbf {v}'$) are different.

At the turning point of the light, if sufficiently close to the critical density, then the evanescent light can tunnel through to the critical surface and resonantly excite an \ac {EPW}. The \ac {EPW} propagates down the density ramp and transfers energy to the electrons through damping.
