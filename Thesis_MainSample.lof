The approximately radially outward flowing, hot (and therefore highly conductive) ablating plasma pulled the magnetic field with it, resulting in radial $\mathbf {B}$ field lines, which were weaker at the capsule equator.

Differences are visible in all plots between the $B_{z0}=0$ and $50\ \text {T}$ simulations, indicating that magnetisation affected \ac {CBET} indirectly, via the altered hydrodynamics.}}{133}{figure.caption.139}%

The difference in variable $v$, is defined as $\Delta v = v_{\text {full-CB}}-v_{\text {partial-CB}}$, so higher colour scale values represent regions with increased $v$ for the full-\ac {CBET} calculation.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.17}{\ignorespaces The oblateness of bangtime density profiles for different magnetisation and \ac {CBET} effects. All values and errors were obtained by fitting an ellipse (with axes orientated along $\hat {\mathbf {x}}$ and $\hat {\mathbf {z}}$), to the radius of maximum density. No-\ac {CBET} simulations were consistently more round, because the initial shock was stronger, and therefore travelled ahead of the pusher material more quickly than the \ac {CBET} equivalent. Thus, after rebounding off the axis, it met the infalling mass and produced thermonuclear conditions at a larger radius. As was seen in Fig.~\ref {fig:Res2_CBETshape_diff}, throughout the entire implosion, when the effect of \ac {CBET} on spatial location of deposition was included, it acted to slightly move energy from the pole to the waist and thus marginally reduced the oblateness of the stagnation state.}}{138}{figure.caption.142}%
